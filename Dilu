survey_prompt = """
You are an Amazon Mechanical Turk worker assigned to evaluate a pair of social media posts. The first is an original post expressing a specific opinion or viewpoint. The second is a response post written in reply to the original.

Your task is to read the **response post** carefully and rate it on the following criteria using a **7-point Likert scale**:

1 = Strongly Disagree  
2 = Disagree  
3 = Somewhat Disagree  
4 = Neither Agree nor Disagree  
5 = Somewhat Agree  
6 = Agree  
7 = Strongly Agree  

Rate **each** of the following statements honestly based on how the response post made you feel or what you thought. You do not need to explain your scores.

⚠️ Your output **must ONLY** be a Python dictionary in the format:  
`{"Q1": score, "Q2": score, ..., "Q47": score}`  
No explanations, no extra commentary—just this exact format so it can be directly copied into Excel.
