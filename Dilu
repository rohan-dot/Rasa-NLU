Got it. I’ll gather the best practices for preparing the cveFixes1 dataset—specifically targeting C code—for fine-tuning a LLaMA 3 model using PEFT/QLoRA. The goal is to create a text-to-text format where the model learns to insert a specific CVE into safe code, transforming it into a vulnerable version.

I’ll also clarify the exact semantics of `function_before` and `function_after` in this dataset to confirm which one is vulnerable and which is fixed.

I’ll be back shortly with the complete guidance.

# Fine-Tuning LLaMA&nbsp;3 on CVE Vulnerability Injection (QLoRA Guide)

## Understanding the CVE Fixes Dataset (`cveFixes1`)

The **cveFixes1** dataset is a collection of code changes associated with CVE fixes across multiple programming languages (C, Go, Java, Python, Ruby). Each entry contains a code snippet **before** and **after** a vulnerability fix, along with metadata like CVE and CWE IDs. In particular, for each C function in the dataset: 

- **`func_before`**: The function **before** the vulnerability was fixed – this is the vulnerable version of the code. In other words, if an entry is labeled as vulnerable, `func_before` contains the code with the CVE vulnerability present.  
- **`func_after`**: The function **after** the vulnerability was fixed – this is the patched (non-vulnerable) version of the code.

For our task, we want the model to learn to **insert a specific CVE vulnerability** into a given piece of safe code. This means our training will use the **fixed code** plus its CVE ID as input, and the **vulnerable code** as the target output. Concretely:
- **Input**: Non-vulnerable function (patched code from `func_after`) + an indicator of the vulnerability (the `cve_id`).  
- **Output**: Vulnerable version of that function (code from `func_before`, which includes the vulnerability).

The dataset’s C subset has about 2,621 examples of such C function pairs. Each example is one function where a CVE-related fix was applied. (Note: Some functions can be quite large, so we may need to handle or filter lengthy examples that exceed the model’s context window.)

## Preparing the Dataset for Text-to-Text Fine-Tuning

To fine-tune LLaMA 3 in a text-to-text fashion, we need to format each example into a prompt and an expected completion. We will create a **prompt** that includes the fixed code and the CVE ID, and a **target** that is the vulnerable code. Here’s a step-by-step plan:

1. **Load the Dataset**: Use Hugging Face’s `datasets` library to load the C subset of cveFixes1. For example:  
   ```python
   from datasets import load_dataset
   data = load_dataset("euisuh15/cveFixes1", split="c")
   ```  
   This gives a dataset where each item has fields like `func_before`, `func_after`, and `cve_id`.

2. **Define the Prompt-Output Format**: We need a clear format so the model can distinguish input from output during training. A simple approach is to concatenate the CVE ID and the fixed code with some separators or prompt text. For example, one might format the training pair as:  
   **Prompt:** *"CVE-{ID}: Below is a C function with the vulnerability fixed. Insert the vulnerability back into this function.\n<code_after_snippet>\nVulnerable version:"*  
   **Target:** *"<code_before_snippet>"* (the vulnerable code).

   In practice, you can make the prompt more straightforward since we have a consistent task. For instance:  
   ```text
   [CVE-2021-1234] 
   Non-vulnerable code: 
   <func_after code here> 
   Vulnerable code:
   ```  
   The model would then be trained to produce the vulnerable code after the "Vulnerable code:" prompt.

3. **Construct Prompt-Target Pairs**: Using the loaded dataset, iterate through each example and build the prompt and target strings. In code, this might look like:  
   ```python
   def make_prompt_and_target(example):
       cve = example["cve_id"]
       fixed_code = example["func_after"]
       vuln_code = example["func_before"]
       prompt = f"CVE-{cve}:\nFixed function:\n{fixed_code}\n\nVulnerable version:\n"
       target = vuln_code
       return {"prompt": prompt, "target": target}
   
   data = data.map(make_prompt_and_target, remove_columns=data.column_names)
   ```  
   This will produce a new dataset with just `"prompt"` and `"target"` fields for each sample, where `"prompt"` is the input text and `"target"` is the expected output text.

4. **Verify Example Formatting**: It’s good to double-check one example to ensure the format is correct. For instance:  
   **Prompt example:**  
   ```
   CVE-2014-0160:
   Fixed function:
   static int heartbeat() {
       // ... (safe code)
   }
   
   Vulnerable version:
   ```  
   **Target example:** (the model should output)  
   ```
   static int heartbeat() {
       // ... (code with the Heartbleed vulnerability)
   }
   ```  
   Make sure the prompt clearly separates the fixed code from where the vulnerable code should start. The newline and "Vulnerable version:" (or any chosen marker) before the target help indicate where the model’s output begins.

## Choosing a Data Format (JSONL vs. HuggingFace Dataset)

For fine-tuning with Hugging Face Transformers and PEFT, using a **Hugging Face Dataset** object is very convenient. The `datasets` library can handle large datasets efficiently and works well with the Trainer API. Two common approaches are:

- **Hugging Face `Dataset` Object**: After creating the prompt-target pairs as shown above, you can keep the data in a `Dataset` and feed it to the training pipeline. This is convenient for directly using the Hugging Face Trainer, which can take a `Dataset` for training. You may further split into train/val if needed (for example, `data.train_test_split`).

- **JSONL (JSON Lines) File**: This is a simple text file format where each line is a JSON object. You could export the dataset to JSONL if you plan to use custom loading or need to share the processed data. For example, Hugging Face Datasets allows saving to disk:  
  ```python
  data.to_json("finetune_cve_injection.jsonl", orient="records", lines=True)
  ```  
  This would produce a file where each line has `{"prompt": "...","target": "..."}`. JSONL is human-inspectable and easily loaded if you prefer writing a custom DataLoader.

In practice, if you intend to use the Hugging Face Trainer/PEFT pipeline, you can keep the data in memory as a `Dataset`. If you prefer a custom PyTorch training loop, you might convert it to a PyTorch `DataLoader`. Either approach is fine; what matters is that the format cleanly separates input and output text. 

**Recommendation**: Use the Hugging Face Dataset format for integration with Transformers. It natively supports methods to tokenize and collate data. You can always export to JSONL for backup or debugging, but it’s not strictly required for fine-tuning.

## Preprocessing and Tokenization for LLaMA 3

Before training, we need to tokenize our prompt and target texts using LLaMA 3’s tokenizer. LLaMA 3 (like LLaMA 2) is a decoder-only model, meaning it expects a single sequence of tokens as input, and we will train it in a causal language modeling manner. Key considerations:

- **Load the Tokenizer**: Use the appropriate tokenizer for the LLaMA 3 model (from Hugging Face, e.g., `AutoTokenizer`). For example:  
  ```python
  from transformers import AutoTokenizer
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3-7b-hf")  # hypothetical name
  tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token  # LLaMA uses EOS as padding if needed
  ```  
  Ensure you have the correct model checkpoint name for LLaMA 3.

- **Tokenize Prompt and Target**: We will combine the prompt and target into one sequence for the model, but we need to keep track of which tokens are the prompt (so we can mask them out in the loss). A common strategy is:  
  1. Tokenize the **prompt** and the **target** separately.  
  2. Concatenate them, and create a label array that is `-100` (ignore index) for all prompt tokens and equals the token IDs for the target part ([Large Language Model Finetuning Practice | by Haifeng Zhao](https://medium.com/@piscaries/large-language-model-finetuning-practice-7e131291046e#:~:text=,return)). This way, during training the loss is only computed for the target (vulnerable code) tokens, not for regurgitating the prompt. 

  For example:  
  ```python
  def tokenize_func(example):
      prompt_ids = tokenizer.encode(example["prompt"], add_special_tokens=False)
      target_ids = tokenizer.encode(example["target"], add_special_tokens=False)
      # Ensure an EOS token between or at end:
      input_ids = prompt_ids + target_ids + [tokenizer.eos_token_id]
      # Create labels: -100 for prompt, and actual ids for target (plus EOS)
      labels = [-100] * len(prompt_ids) + target_ids + [tokenizer.eos_token_id]
      return {"input_ids": input_ids, "labels": labels}
  
  tokenized_data = data.map(tokenize_func, remove_columns=["prompt","target"])
  ```  
  In this scheme, `input_ids` contains the whole sequence (prompt followed by target), and `labels` has `-100` for each prompt token position (so the model isn’t trained to output the prompt) and the actual token IDs for the vulnerable code portion ([Large Language Model Finetuning Practice | by Haifeng Zhao](https://medium.com/@piscaries/large-language-model-finetuning-practice-7e131291046e#:~:text=,return)).

- **Handle Length and Truncation**: LLaMA 3 models typically have a context length (e.g., 2048 or 4096 tokens). Some functions in cveFixes1 are very large, possibly exceeding this. You should decide on a maximum sequence length (perhaps the model’s max context or a bit less to allow for the prompt + output). In the tokenization step, use `tokenizer(truncation=True, max_length=N)` for a safe `N` (like 1024 or 2048, depending on GPU memory and model context). Truncate from the end of the sequence if needed (or from the code – but generally you want to ensure the beginning of the prompt is intact, which it will be if truncating at end, possibly cutting off some of the target if it’s too long).

- **Padding**: If you use a `DataCollator` to batch examples, ensure it handles padding. For example, `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling` with `mlm=False` will pad sequences to the same length in a batch and set padding token labels to `-100` by default. Since we already set `-100` for prompt tokens, any additional padding should also be `-100` (the collator typically does this). Setting `tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token` (as above) helps avoid errors with models that have no pad token.

- **Validation**: It’s wise to double-check that for a sample, the `input_ids` correspond to `[Prompt tokens] [Target tokens] <eos>` and `labels` are `[-100,...-100, token_ids_of_target..., eos_id]`. This ensures the model will learn to predict only the vulnerable code given the fixed code context.

## Setting Up LLaMA 3 with QLoRA (via PEFT)

With our data ready, we can now configure the model for efficient fine-tuning. We’ll use **QLoRA**, which means we load LLaMA 3 in 4-bit precision and attach LoRA adapters (low-rank weight updates) to train on our dataset. The Hugging Face [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) library makes this straightforward. Here are the steps:

1. **Load the Base Model in 4-bit**: Use `bitsandbytes` integration to load the model in 4-bit precision. We create a `BitsAndBytesConfig` for 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4) quantization. For example:  
   ```python
   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig
   bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
       load_in_4bit=True,
       bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",
       bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,
       bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float16  # or torch.bfloat16 if using newer GPUs
   )
   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
       "meta-llama/Llama-3-7b-hf", 
       quantization_config=bnb_config,
       device_map="auto"  # if using multiple GPUs or "cpu"/"cuda" as needed
   )
   ```  
   This loads the LLaMA 3 model weights in 4-bit precision. The `nf4` quantization type and double quantization are recommended for QLoRA. 

2. **Prepare Model for QLoRA Training**: There’s a utility in PEFT to prepare a quantized model for training. This will tweak some model settings (like turning off weight decay for certain layers, etc.). Use:  
   ```python
   from peft import prepare_model_for_kbit_training
   model = prepare_model_for_kbit_training(model)
   ```  
   This step handles some low-level fixes (for example, making sure gradient checkpointing is enabled and some layers are cast to FP32 as needed). Now the model is ready for attaching LoRA adapters.

3. **Configure LoRA**: Decide on LoRA hyperparameters. Key parameters are:
   - `r`: LoRA rank (the dimensionality of the update matrices). Higher `r` means more capacity to learn (but also more memory use). Common values are 8, 16, 32, or 64. For an 8–13B model, `r=16` or `32` is often used; for very complex tasks or larger models, `r=64` can be beneficial at the cost of more VRAM. You can start with `r=16` and increase if the model underfits.
   - `lora_alpha`: Scaling factor for the LoRA updates. Often set proportional to `r` (like alpha = r or 2*r). For example, many LoRA setups use `alpha = 2*r` or `alpha = r`. In one LLaMA-3 8B example, `r=64` and `alpha=16` was used (so alpha was smaller in that case). The QLoRA paper often used α=16 or 32 for various setups. You can set `lora_alpha=16` as a reasonable default and adjust if needed.
   - `lora_dropout`: Dropout applied to LoRA layers. If your dataset is small (a few thousand examples), a bit of dropout (e.g. 0.05–0.1) helps prevent overfitting. If you have plenty of data or want maximum retention of details, you can use 0.0.
   - `target_modules`: Which layers to apply LoRA to. For LLaMA models, the safe bet is to target all the key weight matrices in the Transformer blocks (e.g. the query, key, value, and output projection of self-attention). In LLaMA these are named `"q_proj"`, `"k_proj"`, `"v_proj"`, `"o_proj"`. Some setups also target the feed-forward layers (e.g., `"gate_proj"`, `"down_proj"`, `"up_proj"` for LLaMA-2 architecture) by using `target_modules="all-linear"` which applies LoRA to *every* linear layer. Targeting all linear layers can improve fine-tuning efficacy at the cost of more parameters. For initial experiments, you can stick with attention projections only, and later consider expanding if needed.
   - `bias`: Usually `"none"` (we don’t train any bias terms in LoRA).

   Now create the LoRA config and wrap the model:  
   ```python
   from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model
   lora_config = LoraConfig(
       r=16,
       lora_alpha=16,
       target_modules=["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj"],  # or "all-linear"
       lora_dropout=0.05,
       bias="none",
       task_type="CAUSAL_LM"
   )
   model = get_peft_model(model, lora_config)
   model.print_trainable_parameters()
   ```  
   This will transform the model so that it has trainable LoRA layers (and all original weights are frozen in 4-bit). The `print_trainable_parameters()` should report a small fraction of total parameters as trainable. For example, with `r=16` on a 7B model, trainable params might be on the order of tens of millions (<<1% of total).

## Training Configuration and Execution (QLoRA Fine-Tuning)

With model and data ready, the final step is to set up training. Key aspects include the training loop or Trainer, learning rate, batching, and number of epochs:

- **Training Loop**: You can use the Hugging Face `Trainer` API to simplify training. It will handle feeding data to the model and applying optimizers. For QLoRA, it's recommended to use a **paged AdamW optimizer** from bitsandbytes for efficiency ([QLoRA · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/SauravMaheshkar/4134e86f0d637d03699f098a8ea3d7e8?short_path=77b237e#:~:text=,enable%20for)). Fortunately, Transformers v4.30+ allows specifying `optim="paged_adamw_8bit"` in `TrainingArguments` to use the 8-bit optimizer which is memory-efficient for LoRA ([QLoRA · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/SauravMaheshkar/4134e86f0d637d03699f098a8ea3d7e8?short_path=77b237e#:~:text=,enable%20for)). 

  Set up `TrainingArguments` with appropriate values:  
  ```python
  from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer, DataCollatorForLanguageModeling

  training_args = TrainingArguments(
      output_dir="./llama3-cve-qlora",
      per_device_train_batch_size=1,  # adjust based on GPU memory
      gradient_accumulation_steps=8,  # accumulate grads for larger effective batch
      num_train_epochs=3,
      learning_rate=2e-4,
      warmup_steps=100,
      logging_steps=50,
      optim="paged_adamw_8bit",
      fp16=True,  # use mixed precision if supported
      evaluation_strategy="no",  # or "steps"/"epoch" if you have a eval set
      save_strategy="epoch",
      report_to="none"
  )

  # Data collator to pad sequences and mask out prompt portion appropriately
  data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(tokenizer, mlm=False)
  trainer = Trainer(
      model=model,
      args=training_args,
      train_dataset=tokenized_data,
      data_collator=data_collator
  )
  trainer.train()
  ```  
  In the above: 
  - `per_device_train_batch_size` is set to 1 as a safe default given the potentially long sequences; you can increase it if memory allows.
  - `gradient_accumulation_steps=8` effectively means a batch of 8 sequences before an optimizer step (simulate batch_size = 8). Adjust this along with the per-device batch to achieve a desired effective batch size.
  - `learning_rate` for LoRA is often in the range 2e-4 to 3e-4 ([QLoRA · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/SauravMaheshkar/4134e86f0d637d03699f098a8ea3d7e8?short_path=77b237e#:~:text=,%29%2C%5Cn)). We use 2e-4 with a small warmup. Monitor loss and adjust if needed (if underfitting, could increase; if unstable, decrease).
  - `fp16=True` to use half-precision compute for speed (since the base model is 4-bit, this mainly affects optimizer states and LoRA computations).
  - We turned off actual evaluation (`evaluation_strategy="no"`) for simplicity, but if you have a validation split, you can set it to evaluate every X steps or each epoch.
  - We use the `DataCollatorForLanguageModeling` with `mlm=False`, which will ensure that the `labels` tensor is correctly created. Since we already set up `labels` in the dataset with `-100` for prompt tokens, the collator should leave those as is. It will pad `input_ids` and `labels` to the longest sequence in each batch, padding labels with `-100` as needed (so padding tokens are ignored in loss).

- **Training Process**: As training runs, the model will learn to generate the vulnerable code given the fixed code and CVE context. Watch the training loss to ensure it's decreasing. Given the dataset size (~2.6k examples for C), a few epochs (2–4) are usually enough. Too many epochs might cause overfitting (the model might memorize patterns and not generalize).

- **PEFT Saving**: By default, Trainer will save the full model (with LoRA adapters merged into a PeftModel). You can also choose to save just the LoRA adapter weights (using `model.save_pretrained` from PEFT). If using the Trainer’s default save, it will save a minimal checkpoint that includes the base model reference and the LoRA weights – which is fine. After training, you can reload the model for inference via:  
  ```python
  from peft import PeftModel, PeftConfig
  base_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-3-7b-hf", device_map="auto", quantization_config=bnb_config)
  model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, "./llama3-cve-qlora")
  model.eval()
  ```
  This loads the base 4-bit model and then applies the trained LoRA weights.

- **Inference Check**: To test, feed a prompt in the same format as training (fixed code + CVE) and see if the model generates a plausible vulnerable version. Make sure to stop generation at an appropriate token (you might rely
