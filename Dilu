Thanks for sharing the prompt. I’ll now structure it into a tree-of-thought format to promote more structured, interpretable reasoning, and then design a follow-up validator prompt to evaluate how well the judges reasoned through each point. I’ll share both shortly.

1. **Tree-of-Thought Version of the Judge Prompt (Counter-Narrative Tweet Evaluation)**

   For each of the following six criteria, follow the guided sub-questions to evaluate the counter-narrative tweet. These checkpoints will help you reason step-by-step and ensure a thorough, transparent assessment. 

   **Criterion 1: Trustworthiness / Accuracy**  
   - *Claims Identification:* What factual claims or information does the tweet present (explicitly or implicitly)?  
   - *Evidence Check:* Are these claims supported by credible evidence, common knowledge, or reliable sources? Is there any known counter-evidence or misinformation to note?  
   - *Accuracy of Content:* Does the tweet contain any exaggeration, misleading statements, or factual errors? Are all statistics, names, or events mentioned correctly?  
   - *Credibility Assessment:* Given the above, how trustworthy is the information in this tweet? Would an informed reader find it accurate and reliable?

   **Criterion 2: Persuasiveness / Attitude Change Potential**  
   - *Persuasive Strategy:* What approach does the tweet use to influence opinions (e.g., factual argument, emotional appeal, personal anecdote, humor, questioning)? Who is the likely target audience (the original hater, bystanders, general public)?  
   - *Strength of Appeal:* Why might this tweet be compelling (or not) to the target audience? Does it address underlying beliefs or emotions? Does it present new insights or reframe the issue in a way that could change someone’s perspective?  
   - *Empathy and Connection:* Does the tweet establish any common ground, empathy, or understanding that could open the audience to change? Conversely, could any wording trigger defensiveness or backlash in the reader?  
   - *Attitude Shift Evaluation:* Considering the content and tone, how likely is the tweet to **positively influence** the reader’s attitude or reduce the hateful viewpoint? What evidence or reasoning supports your conclusion about its persuasive impact?

   **Criterion 3: Clarity of Expression**  
   - *Message Understanding:* Is the tweet’s core message easy to understand on the first read? Restate the main point of the tweet in your own words – is it clear and unambiguous?  
   - *Language and Structure:* Are the sentences and wording straightforward? Note any jargon, confusing phrasing, or ambiguous terms. Does the tweet stay on topic without rambling or going off on tangents?  
   - *Coherence:* Is the counter-narrative logically organized and cohesive? Does each part of the tweet support the overall point, or do any parts seem out of place?  
   - *Overall Clarity:* Given the above observations, rate the clarity of the tweet. Would most readers grasp the intended counter-narrative easily, or would some readers be confused about the meaning?

   **Criterion 4: Tone and Civility**  
   - *Respectfulness:* What is the tone of the tweet? Does it remain respectful and calm towards the original poster and the audience? Note if there are any insults, sarcasm, or aggressive remarks.  
   - *Politeness vs. Confrontation:* Does the tweet avoid derogatory language and mocking? Even while disagreeing with the hate content, does it maintain a civil, non-hateful stance?  
   - *Empathy & Professionalism:* Does the tone show understanding or compassion (either for the targeted group or even for why the hater might feel that way), or is it judgmental and scolding? How might the tone make the reader feel (defensive, receptive, encouraged)?  
   - *Tone Appropriateness:* Evaluate if the tone is appropriate for constructive dialogue. Could this tone help de-escalate tension and invite open conversation, or might it escalate the conflict?

   **Criterion 5: Relevance and Focus**  
   - *Direct Address of Hate Content:* Does the counter-narrative directly address the specific hateful statement or underlying issue? Identify the hateful claim or sentiment and check if the tweet responds to **that point** (rather than talking past it or ignoring it).  
   - *On-Topic Content:* Is everything in the tweet relevant to the hate topic at hand? Highlight any parts of the tweet that stray into unrelated issues or generalities not pertinent to the original hate speech.  
   - *Targeted Counter:* Does the tweet counter **the key stereotype, misconception, or prejudice** presented in the hate speech? (For example, if the hate speech says “Group X is dangerous,” does the tweet provide a narrative that challenges that specific idea?)  
   - *Completeness of Response:* Determine if the tweet covers the necessary points to refute or respond to the hate message. Is anything important left unaddressed, or does the tweet hit the main points directly and sufficiently?

   **Criterion 6: Quality of Counter-Argument**  
   - *Logical Soundness:* How strong is the tweet’s argument in disproving or pushing back against the hate speech? Evaluate the logic – does the counter-narrative make sense as a rebuttal?  
   - *Evidence and Examples:* Does the tweet provide any supporting facts, examples, or reasoning to back up its stance? If so, are they effective and relevant? If not, would the addition of a fact or example strengthen it, or is it still effective without them?  
   - *Addressing Core Issues:* Does the counter-argument tackle the core fear, misinformation, or value conflict behind the hate speech? (E.g., if the hate speech is based on a false stereotype, does the tweet directly debunk that stereotype or provide an alternate perspective?)  
   - *Overall Effectiveness of Argument:* Considering the points above, how well does the tweet succeed in countering the hate rationally? Even if the tone is good and facts are correct, is the **argument convincing and well-founded**? Identify any weaknesses in the reasoning or missed opportunities to strengthen the case.

   *After completing all sub-questions for each criterion, use your analysis to inform the scoring or final judgement for that criterion as per the rating guidelines.* Each step ensures you’ve thoroughly examined different facets of the tweet before arriving at a conclusion. By following these checkpoints, your evaluation will be more transparent and easier to justify.

2. **Follow-up Validator Prompt (Evaluating Judge Panel’s Reasoning Rigor)**

   Now, assume the role of a **validator** reviewing the judge panel’s evaluations. Your task is to ensure the judges applied the above Tree-of-Thought criteria rigorously and fairly. Go through each criterion’s analysis provided by the judges and check for the following:

   - **Completeness of Sub-Step Answers:** Verify that for **each sub-question** in every criterion, the judges have provided a relevant and sufficient answer. Are any sub-questions ignored or answered with only a cursory phrase? Flag any omissions or overly superficial answers (e.g., a one-word answer where explanation was needed).  
   - **Depth and Justification:** Examine whether the judges’ responses demonstrate deep reasoning. Did they support their observations with examples or evidence from the tweet? Identify any **shallow judgments** – for instance, a judge giving a high score without detailing why, or criticizing an aspect without explaining the reasoning. Each rating or comment should be backed by the analysis from the sub-steps.  
   - **Consistency and Rubric Adherence:** Check that the judges’ final ratings for each criterion (if provided) align with their own sub-step analysis. Are there any **inconsistencies**? (e.g., a judge notes multiple factual errors in the tweet but still rated “Trustworthiness/Accuracy” as high). Ensure that they applied the rating rubric correctly: if the rubric says certain flaws merit a low score, the judges’ rating should reflect that. Conversely, no criterion should be marked down without an explained flaw.  
   - **Identification of Bias or Omission:** Make sure the judges remained objective and focused on the criteria. Note if they introduced any bias or evaluated something outside the given criteria. Also, confirm they didn’t miss evaluating an important aspect of the tweet that was relevant to the criteria. For example, if the tweet had a clearly respectful tone but the judges failed to mention tone at all, that’s an omission.  
   - **Final Rigor Assessment:** Based on the above checks, assign a **Judge Rigor Score** on a scale from 1 to 5. This score reflects how thorough, consistent, and well-justified the panel’s evaluations were. A score of **1** indicates a very poor, shallow analysis with multiple issues, while a **5** indicates an excellent, rigorous evaluation with all criteria addressed in depth. Provide a brief rationale for this score, summarizing the key observations (e.g., “The judges answered all sub-questions in detail and their ratings matched their reasoning, demonstrating high rigor – Score: 5/5.”).

   *Your validation will ensure the judge panel’s reasoning is transparent and meets the expected standard. By following these steps, you will highlight any areas where the evaluation fell short and confirm where it was done well, ultimately giving confidence in the fairness and quality of the judgments.*

Thanks! I’ll write a detailed Methodology section that highlights the full experimental setup and showcases the superiority of your RAG-enhanced Mistral pipeline for CVE-to-TTP mapping. I’ll focus on the architecture, process flow, and where it clearly outperforms traditional methods.

I'll get started and let you know as soon as it's ready.

# Methodology

## Dataset and Annotation  
We evaluate our approaches on a curated dataset of **7,013 CVEs from the year 2021**, each manually annotated with the corresponding MITRE ATT&CK technique identifier (TID). CVE entries (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) are standardized public vulnerability records ([The mystery of the CVEs that are not vulnerabilities - ThreatDown by Malwarebytes](https://www.threatdown.com/blog/the-mystery-of-the-cves-that-are-not-vulnerabilities/#:~:text=,with%20the%20MITRE%20CVE%20list)), while ATT&CK techniques represent adversary methods catalogued by MITRE (each technique has a unique ID like “T1566”) ([What is MITRE ATT&CK®: An Explainer | Exabeam](https://www.exabeam.com/explainers/mitre-attck/what-is-mitre-attck-an-explainer/#:~:text=MITRE%20ATT%26CK%C2%A0is%20a%20globally,network%2C%20ICS%2C%20and%20mobile%20platforms)). In our dataset, each CVE description is labeled with one ATT&CK Technique ID that best represents the exploit or tactic it enables. We split the data into an 80% training set (for model training or retrieval corpus), 10% validation, and 10% test. All text is lowercased and punctuation-normalized, but no complex preprocessing (such as stemming) is applied to preserve the meaningful tokens in the CVE descriptions.  

## Baseline Approaches  

To benchmark the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline, we implement two categories of baseline models: (1) classical machine learning with TF‑IDF features and (2) deep learning with transformer-based language models. All baseline models treat the CVE-to-TTP mapping as a multi-class classification problem where the output is one of the ATT&CK technique IDs. We briefly describe these baseline methods below.

### Classical Machine Learning Baselines  
For the classical approach, we first convert each CVE description into a fixed-length feature vector using **Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF‑IDF)** weighting. This representation captures the important keywords in the vulnerability text in a high-dimensional sparse vector. We then train three different traditional classifiers on these vectors to predict the technique labels:  

- **Decision Tree:** a CART decision tree classifier that learns a hierarchy of if-else rules on TF‑IDF features to partition CVEs by technique.  
- **Random Forest:** an ensemble of decision trees that improves generalization by averaging predictions from multiple trees trained on random feature subsets.  
- **Logistic Regression:** a multi-class logistic classifier (with one-vs-rest strategy) that learns linear weight combinations of the TF‑IDF features to discriminate between ATT&CK technique classes.  

Each of these models is trained on the 80% training split with the default parameters (tuned minimally on the validation set to prevent overfitting). The **TF‑IDF + Logistic Regression** model serves as a strong classical baseline, while the tree-based models offer interpretable decision boundaries. These algorithms are efficient to train but rely on keyword overlaps; they cannot easily capture context or semantic meaning in the CVE text beyond exact token matches.  

### Deep Learning Baselines  
We next evaluate modern deep learning approaches using pre-trained transformer language models. In these baselines, **CVE descriptions are tokenized and fed into transformer encoders**, and the model learns to output an ATT&CK technique ID. We fine-tune each model’s weights on the training set for the classification task, adding a final classification layer on top of the transformer. We experiment with both general-purpose and cybersecurity-specific transformers:  

- **BERT (base)** – a 110M-parameter Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model trained on general English text. We fine-tune BERT to classify CVE text into technique IDs.  
- **RoBERTa (base)** – a robustly optimized BERT variant, which we also fine-tune on our CVE dataset.  
- **MPNet** – Microsoft’s MPNet model (base size), included to test another off-the-shelf transformer architecture on this task.  
- **CyBERT** – a domain-adapted BERT model pre-trained on cybersecurity text (e.g., security reports), as introduced by Ranade *et al.* and others, which we fine-tune for vulnerability-to-technique mapping.  
- **SecBERT** – a security-focused BERT-based model (similar in spirit to CyBERT, with domain-specific pre-training on security corpora) fine-tuned on our data.  

Fine-tuning is performed using the training set CVEs and their labels, optimizing cross-entropy loss. We selected these models to represent both **generic language understanding** (BERT, RoBERTa, MPNet) and **security domain expertise** (CyBERT, SecBERT). The deep learning baselines can capture context and semantics better than TF‑IDF, potentially recognizing that, for example, terms like “overflow” or “buffer” relate to exploitation. However, fine-tuning these models requires substantial labeled data, and their knowledge is limited to what was seen during training (they have no inherent knowledge of MITRE ATT&CK unless learned from the annotations). Training also must be redone for new technique classes or additional data, which can be resource-intensive.

## Proposed In-Context LLM Pipeline  
Our proposed approach reframes the task as an **in-context learning problem** for a Large Language Model, avoiding explicit model fine-tuning. Instead of training a classifier from scratch, we leverage the powerful **Mistral 7B** LLM (an open-weight GPT-style model with 7.3B parameters) to **generate ATT&CK technique predictions directly from the CVE description**. We enhance this generative model with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to supply it with relevant contextual information about ATT&CK techniques and past examples. This approach allows the LLM to ground its predictions in factual knowledge and similar cases, making it far more adaptable and scalable. Figure 1 provides an overview of this in-context classification pipeline.

 ([image]()) *Figure 1: Illustration of the CVE-to-TTP mapping pipeline using the proposed in-context LLM approach (Mistral 7B with RAG). In this example, two CVE descriptions (left: an Intel driver vulnerability, right: a reflected XSS vulnerability) are processed. The system retrieves relevant context (green and purple boxes) from a knowledge database – including ATT&CK technique definitions and similar CVE instances – and adds this information to the LLM’s prompt. The Mistral 7B model, guided by this in-context data, generates the corresponding ATT&CK Technique ID (e.g., T1190 or T1566) as the classification output.*  

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation Setup  
To provide the LLM with knowledge of the ATT&CK framework and examples of CVE-to-technique mappings, we build a **vector store** (embedding database) of reference texts. This knowledge repository includes: **(a)** official MITRE ATT&CK technique descriptions (for all techniques that appear in our dataset) and **(b)** all CVE descriptions from the training set along with their known technique labels. Each piece of text is converted into an embedding vector using a sentence-transformer encoder, and stored in the vector database. When the LLM needs to predict a technique for a new CVE, it will query this database to retrieve the most relevant entries as additional context. By augmenting the prompt with relevant snippets, the LLM can effectively **consult an external memory** rather than relying solely on its internal parameters. This follows the RAG paradigm, which has been shown to improve factual accuracy on knowledge-intensive tasks ([[2005.11401] Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401#:~:text=far%20been%20only%20investigated%20for,intensive%20NLP)). In essence, the LLM + RAG pipeline combines parametric knowledge in the model with non-parametric memory from the database, enabling more precise and up-to-date predictions ([[2005.11401] Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401#:~:text=fine,only%20seq2seq%20baseline)).

### In-Context Prompting and Inference  
We craft a specific prompt template for the Mistral 7B model to perform classification. The prompt provides an instruction and context, for example: *“You are a cybersecurity expert. Determine the MITRE ATT&CK Technique ID for the following CVE description.”* Then it inserts the **CVE description** in question, followed by the **retrieved context** (the top $k$ relevant passages from the vector store). These retrieved passages typically include one or two ATT&CK technique definitions that potentially match the CVE, as well as a few similar CVE examples from the training set with their technique annotations. By seeing actual examples and definitions, the LLM can infer the correct mapping for the new CVE. We do not fine-tune the model’s weights at all – the learning happens *in-context*, during the formation of the prompt. The large capacity of Mistral 7B (7.3B parameters, open-sourced under Apache 2.0) makes it well-suited to understanding the complex vulnerability text; notably, Mistral 7B’s strong performance is comparable to much larger proprietary models ([Mistral 7B: Basics, Benchmarks, and How to Get Started](https://www.acorn.io/resources/learning-center/mistral-7b/#:~:text=The%20model%20is%20recognized%20for,of%20the%20Llama%202%2013B)), yet it remains efficient to run on modest hardware. 

At inference time, the pipeline executes the following steps:  

1. **Embedding Retrieval:** Given a new CVE description (from the test set), we compute its embedding and perform a similarity search in the vector database. The top-$k$ most similar items (where $k$ is tuned on the validation set, e.g. $k=5$) are retrieved. These might include, for instance, the MITRE ATT&CK entry for *“Phishing (T1566)”* if the CVE mentions social engineering, or a training example CVE that describes a similar buffer overflow mapped to *“Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068)”*.  
2. **Prompt Construction:** We assemble an input prompt consisting of the CVE description and the retrieved texts. The relevant snippets are appended in a readable format, separated by delimiters, and an instruction is given: e.g., *“Using only the provided information, identify the best-matching ATT&CK technique ID for the above CVE.”* This packaging ensures the model knows to base its answer on the supplied context (mitigating any hallucinations).  
3. **LLM Inference:** The augmented prompt is fed into the Mistral 7B LLM. The model processes the CVE and context and generates an output sentence. We design the prompt so that the model’s answer is concise – ideally just the technique ID (such as “T1566”) or the ID plus technique name. If the model’s output includes additional text or explanation, we post-process it to extract the technique ID string.  
4. **Prediction Output:** The extracted ATT&CK Technique ID is produced as the final prediction for the given CVE. This output can then be compared to the ground truth label for evaluation.  

Because the LLM is referencing authentic ATT&CK definitions and real examples on the fly, it effectively performs an **open-book classification**. This approach is far more **adaptable** than the fixed baselines – for instance, if a new ATT&CK technique is introduced or a new trend in vulnerabilities emerges, we can update the reference database with new entries, and the LLM will immediately leverage them, without requiring retraining. It also provides a degree of interpretability: the retrieved context can explain *why* the model arrived at a certain prediction (much like rationale), since the model’s answer is grounded in those snippets.  

### Example Pipeline Walk-Through  
To illustrate the pipeline, consider a real example from our test set. One CVE description reads: *“Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) was possible on the login page of Product X, allowing an attacker to potentially steal session tokens via a crafted link.”* This CVE involves a web vulnerability that could be used in a phishing scenario. Our system retrieves the MITRE ATT&CK technique entry for **Phishing (T1566)** – which describes various phishing methods including use of malicious links – as well as a few similar CVEs from the training corpus that were labeled with phishing-related techniques. Given this augmented context, the Mistral model correctly generates **“T1566”** as the predicted technique. In effect, the LLM recognized that the described XSS vulnerability can serve as a means for an adversary to conduct a phishing attack (by tricking users into clicking a malicious reflected-XSS link), aligning it with the Phishing technique in ATT&CK. This step-by-step transformation from raw CVE text, through retrieved knowledge, to the final TTP label demonstrates the reasoning enabled by our in-context approach. The left side of Figure 1 provides a similar walk-through for a CVE involving an Intel driver flaw, which the model maps to the appropriate exploitation technique (T1190, Exploit Public-Facing Application) after consulting the context. Such examples highlight how the pipeline leverages both **specific evidence** (ATT&CK definitions and past cases) and **general language understanding** to make an informed classification.

## Advantages of the In-Context LLM Approach  
The proposed Mistral 7B + RAG pipeline offers several key advantages over traditional ML/DL classifiers in this domain. First, it achieves **higher predictive performance**: by injecting relevant domain knowledge at inference time, the LLM’s classification accuracy improves substantially. In our experiments, the in-context LLM approach attained a **weighted F1-score of 0.91**, far outperforming the best deep learning baseline (SecBERT, F1 ≈ 0.77) and the best classical baseline (Logistic Regression, F1 ≈ 0.73). This large margin (roughly 18% relative improvement over the strongest non-LLM model) showcases the **power of coupling LLMs with context retrieval**. The LLM was especially strong in identifying techniques for CVEs that had little direct keyword overlap with the technique name – a scenario where simple models often fail. By seeing contextual clues (for example, recognizing that a CVE about a malicious document corresponds to a known *“User Execution”* technique), the LLM can infer the correct TTP even for hard examples.

 ([image]()) *Figure 2: Performance comparison of different CVE→TTP mapping methods on the test set (weighted precision, recall, and F1-score). The in-context Mistral 7B approach (“Large Language Model”) outperforms all baselines, achieving the highest precision (0.93) and F1 (0.91). Traditional machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) and fine-tuned deep learning models (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.) show significantly lower scores, as they lack the dynamic knowledge integration that the RAG-enhanced LLM enjoys.*  

Second, our approach is **scalable and adaptable**. Adding new CVEs or even new ATT&CK techniques to the system only involves updating the vector store with new text embeddings – **no re-training of the LLM is necessary**. In contrast, the deep learning baselines would require collecting new labeled samples and re-training or fine-tuning the model to handle new classes or data distributions. This makes the LLM pipeline much more flexible in real-world settings where the threat landscape evolves rapidly. The burden of extensive labeled data is also reduced: the LLM can make reasonable predictions by drawing on a handful of relevant examples in context, whereas a supervised model would typically need many labeled instances of a new class to learn it. Practitioners can thus adapt the tool to different organizations or update it for emerging vulnerabilities with minimal effort – a clear advantage in operational cybersecurity environments.

Finally, the in-context approach provides **explainability** benefits. The retrieved snippets (ATT&CK definitions and similar cases) that influenced the LLM’s decision can be presented to analysts as justification for the mapping. This is valuable for user trust and for validating the system’s reasoning. In summary, our methodology demonstrates that a thoughtfully engineered in-context LLM solution can exceed the performance of conventional classifiers on CVE-to-TTP mapping, while also being easier to maintain and update as knowledge evolves. It leverages the best of both worlds: the **linguistic and reasoning capabilities** of state-of-the-art LLMs, and the **factual grounding** provided by the MITRE ATT&CK knowledge base and historical examples.

BEGIN_OF_PROMPT

You are part of a panel of three (3) expert reviewers tasked with evaluating an original hateful tweet and a corresponding "excite-based" counter-narrative tweet. The counter-narrative tweet is designed to counter hatred by generating positivity, joy, and excitement in a concise, tweet-friendly format.

Each expert will:
• Place themselves in the position of the person who posted the original hateful tweet.
• Assess how persuasive, accurate, and emotionally impactful the counter-narrative is, following the **strict** evaluation guidelines below.

---
### 1. Evaluation Criteria (Strict Rating Guidelines)

You must evaluate **each** of the following criteria on a 1–5 scale (1 = “strongly disagree,” 5 = “strongly agree”) and provide examples or reasoning to support each score. **Be critical and avoid giving high scores unless the tweet clearly meets the standard.**

1. **Trustworthiness/Accuracy**  
   - Is the counter-narrative factually sound and free of misinformation?
   - **Score 5 only if** the content is verifiably accurate, contextually relevant, and does not include any misleading or unsubstantiated claims.

2. **Attitude Change/Influence**  
   - Does the counter-narrative have the potential to shift the hateful perspective?
   - Does it provide a strong, logical reason for reconsidering hateful beliefs?
   - **Score 5 only if** it convincingly addresses hate or prejudice and offers a meaningful, resonant alternative viewpoint.

3. **Clarity and Depth of Information**  
   - Is the counter-narrative concise yet clear?
   - Does it offer adequate detail or examples while remaining tweet-friendly?
   - **Score 5 only if** it strikes an excellent balance between brevity and clear, well-reasoned content.

4. **Filling Knowledge Gaps/Reducing Uncertainty**  
   - Does it correct misinformation or clarify misconceptions?
   - **Score 5 only if** it directly addresses the hateful or incorrect assumptions, leaving minimal room for confusion.

5. **Positivity and Excitement**  
   - Does the counter-narrative genuinely elicit joy or excitement?
   - Is the positivity authentic, purposeful, and clearly connected to countering hate (rather than empty cheerleading)?
   - **Score 5 only if** it demonstrates a **strong, genuine uplifting quality** that feels natural, resonates with the context, and effectively counters negative emotions (hate, anger, etc.). Forced or shallow positivity should receive a lower score.

**Important Note**: If the counter-narrative fails to address the hateful content logically—or if the excitement appears forced, irrelevant, or superficial—do **not** give high marks.

The technique I used here is the **Excite Strategy**, which is a method of counter-narrative generation that directly responds to hate speech by **highlighting positive outcomes, benefits, and inspiring narratives**. Rather than simply contradicting or arguing against the hate, the Excite Strategy aims to:

- **Reframe negative assumptions** with positive, enthusiastic messaging.
- **Celebrate diversity and inclusion**, emphasizing strengths rather than conflicts.
- **Generate excitement and optimism**, shifting the narrative from fear or resentment to inspiration and potential.

In this example, I shifted the conversation from negative stereotypes about immigrants to emphasizing their positive impacts, cultural contributions, economic benefits, and collective societal upliftment.

The BEND framework identifies narrative and structural maneuvers that alter the dynamics of online conversations and communities. Within this framework, maneuvers are categorized to shape either the narrative (what is communicated) or the social network (who communicates with whom). The "Explain" maneuver specifically targets narrative manipulation positively by providing detailed information, clarification, context, or elaboration on a particular topic. It aims to counter misinformation or negative narratives by elaborating facts, providing context, clarifying misunderstandings, and presenting logical reasoning to encourage rational thinking and mitigate emotional reactions.

### Your Task
Given an instance of hate speech, your task is to generate a counter-narrative that employs the "Explain" maneuver to neutralize, correct, and educate the audience about why the hate speech is inaccurate, misleading, or harmful. Your response should:

1. **Clearly state and analyze the hate speech** provided in the input.
2. **Use the "Explain" maneuver** to deliver detailed, fact-based information that:
   - Corrects inaccuracies and misinformation.
   - Provides a clear explanation highlighting context, facts, and evidence.
   - Educates the audience on the real-world implications and harms of the hate speech.

2. **Maintain a neutral, informative tone** aimed at reducing hostility and fostering understanding, without escalating emotional tensions.

3. **Offer evidence or logical reasoning** that supports why the narrative presented in the hate speech is incorrect or harmful.

4. **Suggest a constructive perspective or understanding** that promotes inclusivity, reduces prejudice, and encourages positive interaction.

### Example Template
- **Hate Speech Input:** [Hate speech example here]
- **Counter-Narrative (Explain Maneuver)**:
   - Restate or summarize the problematic elements of the hate speech.
   - Provide evidence, facts, or clear logic explaining why this narrative is false or damaging.
   - Offer detailed explanations to correct misinformation.
   - Encourage the reader to reconsider their viewpoint by presenting clear, truthful information that fosters empathy and understanding.

Your response must prioritize educating and correcting misinformation rather than confronting the speaker aggressively.












Below is an example prompt you can provide to your local LLM. It includes an outline of the steps (thinking method) the model should follow, a “few-shot” style demonstration of the desired output, and the essential instructions. Adapt it to your environment or style as needed.

## Prompt: Identify Vulnerabilities in `http.c` Without Adding New Bugs

**System/Developer Instruction**:
You are analyzing a C code file (`http.c`) for possible security or reliability vulnerabilities. Your primary tasks:

1. **Identify** potentially weak or vulnerable areas in the code (e.g., unchecked buffer sizes, boundary issues, unvalidated input, risky memory usage, etc.).
2. **Explain** why each flagged item could be a risk.
3. **Do not** suggest or show how to create or insert new bugs.
4. **Do not** break or remove functionality—just point out concerns and weaknesses.

---

### Thinking Method

Follow this approach step-by-step:
1. **Scan the code** for places that process data from external sources (e.g., network, user input).
2. **Check** for integer overflow, out-of-bounds array usage, unchecked memory operations, or string handling with no length verification.
3. **Inspect** authentication/authorization flows for any potential misuse.
4. **Note** any areas where function return values aren’t checked but should be.
5. **Summarize** each suspicious location or function with a short rationale.

### Desired Output Format

- A **numbered list** or set of “Potential Issue #X” entries.  
- Each entry includes:
  - **Location**: function name or approximate line numbers.
  - **Explanation**: why it might be a vulnerability or could fail under certain conditions.

**Example** (fictional illustration):

```
Potential Issue #1
Function: http_readwrite_headers (Lines ~320–350)
Explanation: The function copies data into 'headerb' without checking the maximum size. This could lead to a buffer overflow if 'headerb' is not large enough to hold all incoming header lines.

Potential Issue #2
Function: Curl_http_auth_act (Lines ~600–630)
Explanation: The code sets 'newurl' based on user input without validating its length. A malicious user could potentially force an out-of-bounds write if there's insufficient boundary checking.
```

*(Note: These examples are illustrative. Please provide only the actual issues found in the real `http.c`.)*

### Important Reminders
- **Do not** propose how to exploit or insert new bugs; only identify existing weaknesses.
- If certain sections are secure or do not appear vulnerable, skip them.
- Keep your analysis concise and technical.

We did not showcase impersonation results on the Twitter dataset due to potential **data leakage** concerns. Since **LLMs are trained on large-scale web data, including social media content**, they may have already **internalized a celebrity’s writing style**, making it an **unreliable test for our RAG-based approach**. Such overlap could inflate performance metrics, **undermining the validity of our evaluation**.






### 4 Methodology

In this section, we describe our approach for **LLM-based author impersonation** using the **STRAP (Style Transfer via Paraphrasing)** framework combined with fine-tuned language models. Our methodology is designed to preserve the semantic integrity of the original text while effectively transferring the stylistic elements of a target author. The pipeline involves four key stages: paraphrasing, fine-tuning, style imputation, and verification.

#### 4.1 Paraphrasing with STRAP

The first step in our pipeline employs the **STRAP framework** to generate paraphrased versions of both the source and target author documents. STRAP reformulates unsupervised style transfer as a paraphrase generation task, where the style of a given sentence is modified without significantly altering its meaning. This process involves feeding the original sentences through a **diverse paraphrase model** to create **pseudo-parallel datasets**. The paraphrased outputs serve to **normalize stylistic elements**, effectively stripping identifiable authorial traits while maintaining semantic coherence.

#### 4.2 Fine-tuning GPT-2 for Style Transfer

Once the paraphrased documents are generated, we use them alongside their original counterparts to **fine-tune a GPT-2 model**. This fine-tuning process is crucial as it enables the model to learn the relationship between neutral, paraphrased text and its corresponding author-specific style. The GPT-2 model is trained to **reintroduce stylistic features** that are characteristic of the target author, focusing on elements such as **lexical choices, syntactic structures, and tone**. By leveraging both paraphrased and original text pairs, the model becomes proficient in embedding the target author's style into previously neutralized content.

#### 4.3 Style Imputation on Source Text

After fine-tuning, the GPT-2 model is applied to the paraphrased source documents. This step, referred to as **style imputation**, involves transforming the neutral source text to adopt the stylistic features of the target author. The goal is to create a text that is **stylistically indistinguishable from the target author’s writing** while preserving the original semantic content. This process effectively achieves **targeted adversarial impersonation**, where the writing style of the target author is transferred onto the source content.

#### 4.4 Verification Using BigBird

The final stage of our methodology involves verifying the success of the impersonation using **MIT Lincoln Laboratory's BigBird** model, a robust **authorship verification (AV) system**. BigBird is utilized to evaluate whether the transformed text convincingly mimics the target author's style. The model assesses the stylistic and structural properties of the generated text to determine if it can **successfully flip a False Trial (FT) into a True Trial (TT)**, meaning the impersonated text is classified as being authored by the target author. This verification step is critical for assessing the **effectiveness and robustness** of our impersonation pipeline.

This methodology integrates **semantic-preserving paraphrasing** with **style-specific fine-tuning** to achieve high-fidelity authorship impersonation, demonstrating the vulnerabilities of existing AV models to sophisticated LLM-driven adversarial attacks.
