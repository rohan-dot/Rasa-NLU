**Subject:** Vacation Request and Plan to Make Up Time

Dear \[Group Office/Admin Name],

I hope you're doing well.

I'm writing to inform you that I will be on vacation from **November 17th to January 2nd**, which accounts for **26 working days**. By that time, I will have accrued **108 hours** of vacation, equivalent to **13.5 days**. Given the option to go **40 hours (5 days)** into the negative, this still leaves **7 days unaccounted for**.

To make up for this time, I propose either of the following options:

1. **Work 9-hour days** for the next **11 weeks**, adding approximately **5 extra hours per week** to compensate for the shortfall.
2. Alternatively, I am happy to **work in-person from the lab every second Saturday** until the required hours are made up.

During these extended hours, I will ensure that all communication and collaboration with peers and PIs takes place within standard working hours via Zoom or in-person meetings. The additional time will be dedicated to tasks such as coding, drafting papers, or progressing technical work that does not require peer support—ensuring minimal disruption to others' schedules.

Please let me know which option would be more suitable, or if there's a preferred alternative.

Best regards,
\[Your Name]
