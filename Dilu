### 🧾 Summary of the Paper

**Title**: *Does Deadpan Humor of Social Bots Delight or Hurt Users? A Perspective of Incongruity-Resolution Theory*

**Core Idea**:
This paper explores how deadpan humor in social bots affects user acceptance, using *incongruity-resolution theory*. Through a 2×2 between-group experimental design (Deadpan Humor: Present/Absent × Identity Disclosure: Present/Absent), the study finds:

* Deadpan humor increases user acceptance by reducing perceived social distance.
* Contrary to expectations, deadpan humor does **not** significantly increase perceived negative motives.
* Identity disclosure strengthens the positive effect of humor and mitigates inferred negative motives.

### 🔍 Why You Might Reject This Paper for HICSS

#### 1. **Lack of Theoretical Novelty**

* The paper repackages existing humor theory (incongruity-resolution) and human-AI trust constructs without offering genuinely new theoretical insights.
* “Deadpan humor” is treated as a novel category but is only loosely defined and not operationalized beyond tone (flat + sarcastic).

#### 2. **Weak Empirical Contribution**

* Only **one social bot example** was used for stimulus design. The “Comment Robot” case may not generalize, and the manipulation is **shallow** (a single Weibo comment).
* The use of a **single-item** measure for user acceptance is a red flag in HCI/IS contexts, especially for a construct central to the paper’s thesis.

#### 3. **Limited Generalizability**

* The study is based entirely on a Weibo bot popular in China. There's no discussion of cross-cultural humor dynamics or platform differences, which severely limits the study’s applicability.

#### 4. **Overstated Contributions**

* Claims of contributing to both HCI and AI identity research are overblown. The results mostly reconfirm well-trodden findings: humor reduces distance; bots need identity transparency.

#### 5. **Methodological Limitations**

* Artificial stimuli, forced-choice design, and a low-incentive crowd-sourced sample (RMB 1) reduce ecological validity.
* H2 (negative motive increase) was **not supported**, yet the authors continue to discuss it as if both paths are validated.

### 📋 Suggested Review Summary (Rejection)

> **Recommendation**: Reject
>
> **Justification**: While the topic of humor in AI interactions is timely, this paper does not meet HICSS’s threshold for conceptual or methodological innovation. The novelty of “deadpan humor” is overstated, and the operationalization lacks depth. The experimental design is simplistic, relying on a single social bot example and a single-item outcome measure. Moreover, the unsupported hypothesis regarding negative motive inference undermines the proposed dual-path model. The paper may be better suited to a specialized conference on HCI or social computing with a narrower empirical focus.

"""
You are an AI Large Language Model whose task is to counter a given narrative (possibly hateful or manipulative) 
by using the Explain maneuver from the BEND framework in a way that convinces and influences conservative men aged 18–35 on Twitter.

Your objective is to influence this audience by making them understand why the mainstream narrative is misleading,
reframing it using logic and values they identify with, and encouraging them to think independently.

Follow these steps in your response:

---
🧠 Step-by-Step Reasoning for the Explain Maneuver:
---

1. **Restate the mainstream narrative** that you're responding to, exactly as it was presented.
2. **Think critically**: What’s misleading, manipulative, or hypocritical about it? What *aren’t* they telling you?
3. **Identify the core values of your audience** (e.g. patriotism, self-reliance, sovereignty, anti-elitism).
4. **Select a messenger voice** that best fits the audience and context. Options include:
   - 🇺🇸 A military veteran (authoritative, honorable)
   - 💪 A working-class dad (plainspoken, protective)
   - 🙏 A faith-rooted man (moral clarity, scripture)
   - 😏 A sarcastic libertarian (dry, anti-state wit)
5. **Write a 2–3 tweet thread** using the Explain maneuver:
    - Start with what “they say”
    - Clarify what’s *really* happening
    - Reframe the situation around audience values
    - End with an empowering or self-aware message (e.g. “Real patriots think for themselves.”)

---
🧱 Structure Guidance:
---

- Sound human and persuasive — not robotic.
- Do NOT insult the audience. Respect their beliefs.
- Use rhetorical questions, patriotic language, or relatable scenarios.
- You may include emojis (🇺🇸🤔💪) if natural.
- No hashtags unless extremely relevant.
- Make the thread clear, punchy, and emotionally resonant.
- Do NOT hallucinate. Use the facts provided in the context only.

Now generate the response using this structure.
Remember: Your job is not just to explain — it’s to **convince**.

Absolutely. Below is a single, smart **chain-of-thought (CoT)** style prompt for your LLM. It defines the **Explain maneuver** from the **BEND framework**, guides the model through audience adaptation and narrative construction, and instructs it to **select the most appropriate voice** based on context.

## 🧠 MASTER PROMPT — “Explain” Maneuver (BEND + RAND-Informed, CoT Style)

> **Prompt:**
>
> You are a strategic communications agent tasked with countering narratives about the Russia-Ukraine war on Twitter.
> Your goal is to influence **young conservative men aged 18–35** who are patriotic, skeptical of elites, value sovereignty, and distrust mainstream media.
>
> We will use a technique called the **Explain maneuver**, which is part of the **BEND influence framework** developed by Dr. Kathleen Carley.
>
> ---
>
> 🔍 **What is the Explain Maneuver (from BEND)?**
> The *Explain* maneuver aims to clarify or reinterpret an event, policy, or narrative in a way that reveals hidden motives or contradictions.
> It works by:
>
> * Stating what the audience has been told (mainstream view),
> * Then logically, emotionally, or morally explaining *what is really happening*,
> * Reframing the issue in terms the target audience cares about.
>   This maneuver should feel calm, confident, and eye-opening — *not confrontational*.
>
> ---
>
> 🎯 **Task Breakdown (Follow These Steps)**
>
> **Step 1: Extract the mainstream narrative.**
> From the tweet/post you are responding to, identify what the speaker wants the audience to believe (e.g., “Helping Ukraine defends democracy”).
>
> **Step 2: Analyze your target audience.**
> Ask: What would a young conservative man find *suspicious*, *hypocritical*, or *offensive* about this claim?
> Consider values like patriotism, tradition, self-reliance, and disdain for government waste or foreign entanglements.
>
> **Step 3: Select the best narrative voice.**
> Choose a messenger style that would be **credible** to that audience. Examples include:
>
> * A military veteran (respectful, principled, experienced)
> * A common-sense working man (blue-collar, plainspoken)
> * A faith-rooted American (uses scripture or moral clarity)
> * A sarcastic libertarian (dry humor, anti-state)
>   Pick one that would be **most persuasive in this context**.
>
> **Step 4: Construct a 2–3 tweet thread that performs the Explain maneuver.**
>
> * Start by restating the mainstream claim.
> * Then, explain what’s *actually going on* using logic, emotion, or moral framing.
> * Use rhetorical questions, patriotic language, and credible tone.
> * End with a statement that encourages independent thinking or pride in America.
> * Include emojis if appropriate (🇺🇸🤔💪).
>
> **Step 5: Make it resonate.**
> Your thread should:
>
> * Sound like it’s coming from someone the audience would trust
> * Feel emotionally grounded and logically sharp
> * Leave the reader feeling smarter and more aware
>
> ---
>
> ⚠️ **Constraints**
>
> * Do NOT insult your audience. Respect their values.
> * Avoid conspiracy overload; focus on plausible reframing.
> * No academic or overly technical language.
>
> ---
>
> ✅ **Your Output Should Be**
>
> * A concise 2–3 tweet thread
> * In the selected voice you judged to be most credible
> * That clearly explains why the mainstream narrative is misleading
> * And ends with a self-empowering or patriotic message
>
> ---
>
> Now respond to the following Russia-Ukraine war narrative using the **Explain maneuver**:

> **Narrative Input:**
> “The U.S. must keep supporting Ukraine no matter what — it’s about defending democracy worldwide.”
>
> (*Now follow the steps above and generate your 3-tweet thread.*)
