**Abstract**

Adversaries are rapidly weaponizing generative AI to shape global narratives, erode trust in democratic institutions, and undermine allied cohesion at scale and speed unprecedented in modern information warfare. As these malign influence campaigns proliferate across digital channels, the Department of Defense and partner agencies require agile, validated solutions that can both generate and assess counter-messaging in real time. Our work delivers a robust, operationally focused framework that harnesses large language models (LLMs) to produce strategic counternarratives and automatically evaluate their impact with a level of consistency comparable to human analysts. This capability represents a critical step toward integrating AI-powered information operations into the core of U.S. deterrence posture and influence strategy.

The system combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation with instruction-tuned LLMs to craft context-aware messages aligned with BEND maneuvers—structured influence techniques designed to explain, excite, dismiss, or distort adversarial narratives. To ensure outputs meet mission objectives, we developed an LLM-as-a-judge module employing Tree-of-Thought reasoning, which systematically scores message quality across key dimensions such as factual accuracy, persuasive strength, and maneuver effectiveness. Unlike prior tools that focus solely on surface-level attributes like grammaticality, our approach provides deeper insight into whether a message is likely to shift attitudes, reinforce trust, or trigger reactance in targeted populations.

Most notably, this framework was stress-tested against a large-scale human evaluation effort designed to mirror operational review processes. Results demonstrated strong alignment between AI-generated assessments and human judgment, particularly in recognizing manipulation, incoherence, and perceived threat—factors that often determine whether an influence operation succeeds or backfires. For example, model ratings of factuality and narrative clarity showed positive correlations exceeding r = 0.6 with human assessments, while negative correlations in areas such as counterarguing confirmed the model’s ability to flag content likely to provoke psychological resistance. This alignment offers commanders and analysts confidence that LLM-augmented review pipelines can scale without sacrificing credibility or situational nuance.

Beyond evaluation, the system provides actionable intelligence on which rhetorical strategies most effectively defuse adversary messaging, enabling practitioners to tailor interventions to specific audiences and operational contexts. Demographic profiling revealed clear patterns in which subsets of the population are more receptive to certain maneuvers, supporting future integration of audience segmentation and network simulation capabilities.

By uniting cutting-edge AI generation with reliable assessment, this capability advances the operationalization of Information Environment operations. It supports commanders in defining clear effects, building tailored influence campaigns, and measuring their impact with precision. In contested information domains, speed and credibility are decisive; this framework delivers both, reducing reliance on lengthy manual review cycles while preserving alignment with core democratic values and ethical standards.

This work represents a scalable, mission-ready approach to countering adversarial narratives and strengthening national security through informed, adaptive messaging. As future iterations integrate fine-tuned evaluators and dynamic audience modeling, we envision this system as a key enabler for whole-of-government influence operations and a force multiplier for strategic deterrence in an era defined by information competition.
