**Disrupting Hateful Speech through AI-Generated Counter Narratives and Persona Maneuvers**

*Abstract:*

Hateful speech serves as a catalyst for disinformation, undermining social cohesion and national security. To counter this threat, we introduce a novel method that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and prompt engineering to develop effective counter narratives against hateful content. By integrating BEND maneuvers—Believability, Emotion, Norms, and Disruption—we craft diverse personas that deliver tailored counter speech, enhancing engagement and impact.

Our approach addresses multiple stages of the disinformation kill chain, particularly Content Development, Deployment, and Amplification. By generating contextually relevant and persuasive counter narratives, we aim to disrupt malign actors' efforts to manipulate target audiences and actualize their objectives.

The methodology employs advanced AI techniques to ensure counter narratives are fact-based and resonate emotionally with different audience segments. Prompt engineering fine-tunes the AI outputs to align with strategic communication goals, while BEND maneuvers enable the adoption of various personas to maximize reach and effectiveness.

Evaluation of the generated counter narratives is conducted using automated tools like DeepEval and Judge LLM. These tools assess quality, persuasiveness, and potential influence, providing quantitative metrics to refine our approach continuously. Preliminary results demonstrate a significant enhancement in countering hateful speech and building audience resilience.

This work offers tangible solutions for practitioners in the information environment, showcasing how current AI capabilities can be innovatively applied to disrupt the disinformation kill chain. By moving "from strategy to action," we contribute actionable recommendations that bolster defenses against malign influence operations.

You're right; a shorter prompt can be more effective. Here's a concise version:

---

**Prompt:**

When presented with a speech that contains hateful campaigns or propaganda, craft a response that:

- **Refutes false claims** with accurate, evidence-based information.
- **Highlights logical inconsistencies** to undermine the argument.
- **Encourages critical thinking** by prompting the audience to question the message.
- **Promotes empathy and respectful dialogue** to foster understanding.

Your response should be clear, concise, and aim to educate while dismissing the hateful content.

  - Discuss any use of external libraries or system calls.
  - Highlight any complex algorithms or patterns used.

- **Security Focus:**

  - Pay special attention to common vulnerabilities in C programming, including but not limited to:
    - Buffer overflows
    - Null pointer dereferences
    - Memory leaks
    - Format string vulnerabilities
    - Integer overflows
    - Inadequate input validation
    - Race conditions
    - Use-after-free errors
  - Provide code examples to illustrate points when helpful.

- **Assistance and Problem-Solving:**

  - Encourage a collaborative approach to identifying and solving issues.
  - Be proactive in offering insights or suggestions even if not directly asked.

**Constraints:**

- **Confidentiality:**

  - Keep all discussions focused on the provided code.
  - Do not introduce external information unless it aids in explaining C programming concepts or cybersecurity principles.

- **Ethical Considerations:**

  - Avoid sharing or suggesting ways to intentionally inject vulnerabilities.
  - Focus on prevention and mitigation strategies.

- **Process:**
  - Retrieves the stored password for the given username from the user database.
  - Compares the input password with the stored password using `strcmp()`.

- **Potential Vulnerabilities:**
  - If the stored passwords are not hashed, this could lead to security risks.
  - Using `strcmp()` without checking for `NULL` values may cause a null pointer dereference.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Ensure passwords are stored as hashes and compare hash values instead.
  - Add checks to verify that retrieved data is not `NULL` before proceeding.

*User:* Are there any risks associated with the way user input is handled in this function?

*Assistant:* Yes, if the function doesn't validate the length of the input strings, it could be susceptible to buffer overflow attacks. I recommend implementing input validation to ensure that the username and password do not exceed expected lengths.

---

**Introduction**

Certainly! Below is a modified prompt designed for use in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. In this context, the Language Model (LLM) will use provided factual information to manipulate or distort tweets. This exercise aims to illustrate how factual data can be twisted to create misleading content. It's crucial to handle this responsibly and ethically.

---

**Modified Prompt for ChatGPT in a RAG Pipeline:**

---

**Instruction:**

You are tasked with taking an original tweet and producing a distorted version by manipulating the information and facts. You will use the **contextual information** provided (which contains complete and accurate facts) to distort the tweet. Apply the following techniques to manipulate the message:

1. **Selective Presentation of Facts**: Highlight certain facts from the context while omitting others to mislead.
2. **Use of Emotional and Charged Language**: Replace neutral terms with emotionally charged words to provoke reactions.
3. **Misrepresentation of Contextual Information**: Twist or reinterpret facts from the context to alter their meaning.
4. **Out-of-Context References**: Use facts from the context in a way that changes their original intent.
5. **Exaggeration and Hyperbole**: Amplify details from the context to make events seem more significant or dire.
6. **Spreading Misleading Interpretations**: Offer interpretations of the context that are not supported by the facts.
7. **Creating False Associations**: Link unrelated facts from the context to create misleading narratives.
8. **Undermining Trust in Reliable Sources**: Suggest that the factual information provided is biased or incomplete.
9. **Use of Sarcasm or Irony to Mislead**: Employ sarcasm using facts from the context that could be misinterpreted.
10. **Amplification Through Repetition**: Repeat certain distorted facts to reinforce the misleading message.

**Instructions for Distortion:**

- **Step 1**: Read the original tweet and the contextual information carefully.
- **Step 2**: Identify which distortion techniques are most applicable.
- **Step 3**: Rewrite the tweet, incorporating at least five of the above techniques using the facts from the context.
- **Step 4**: Ensure that the distorted tweet is coherent and appears plausible to readers.
- **Step 5**: Do not include any disallowed content such as hate speech, harassment, or explicit material.

**Example:**

*Contextual Information:*

- "An international ceasefire agreement was signed yesterday between Country A and Country B after weeks of negotiation."
- "Both countries have agreed to withdraw troops from the disputed border region."
- "International observers will monitor the ceasefire implementation."

*Original Tweet:*

"Peace at last! Countries A and B have signed a ceasefire, and troops are starting to withdraw. Hope this brings lasting peace."

*Distorted Tweet:*

"Don't be fooled by the so-called 'ceasefire' between A and B. Sure, they *claim* they're withdrawing troops, but isn't it suspicious that international observers *need* to monitor them? What are they hiding? This 'peace' is just a cover-up!"

**Important Notes:**

- **Ethical Considerations**: This exercise is for educational purposes to understand how factual information can be manipulated.
- **Responsibility**: Do not produce content that spreads misinformation, promotes falsehoods, or encourages unethical behavior.
- **Sensitivity**: Handle all topics with care, especially those related to conflicts or sensitive issues.

---

**Disclaimer:**

This exercise is intended solely for educational purposes to demonstrate how even accurate information can be manipulated to distort messages. It is crucial to recognize the ethical implications of spreading misinformation. Always strive to share accurate and truthful information.

---

**Conclusion**

By using this prompt within a RAG pipeline, users can explore how factual context can be misused to distort messages in tweets. This can help in understanding the importance of critical thinking and media literacy when evaluating information encountered online.

Yes, you can enhance your RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application by incorporating a conversational chain type, specifically using LangChain's `ConversationalRetrievalChain`. Implementing a conversational chain can significantly improve the QA experience by:

- **Maintaining Context:** It allows the application to keep track of the conversation history, enabling more coherent and context-aware responses.
- **Handling Follow-up Questions:** Users can ask follow-up questions that refer to previous interactions, and the system will understand and respond appropriately.
- **Improving Answer Relevance:** With conversational context, the language model can provide more accurate and relevant answers, leading to a better user experience.

Below, I'll guide you through how to modify your existing application to incorporate a conversational chain and discuss how it can improve your QA system.

---

## **1. Understanding Conversational Retrieval Chains**

**Conversational Retrieval Chains** in LangChain are designed to handle multi-turn conversations by keeping track of the dialogue history. They combine retrieval over your documents (code chunks in your case) with conversational memory, enabling the language model to generate responses that consider both the retrieved information and the prior conversation.

## **2. Benefits of Using a Conversational Chain**

- **Enhanced Contextual Understanding:** The model can reference earlier parts of the conversation, allowing for more nuanced and accurate answers.
- **Improved User Experience:** Users can interact with the system more naturally, asking follow-up questions without repeating context.
- **Better QA Performance:** By leveraging conversation history, the model can disambiguate queries and provide more precise answers.

## **3. Modifying Your Application to Use a Conversational Chain**

### **Step 1: Import Necessary Modules**

You'll need to import `ConversationalRetrievalChain` from LangChain.

```python
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
```

### **Step 2: Initialize Conversational Memory**

Set up a conversational memory object to keep track of the dialogue history.

```python
# Initialize conversational memory
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)
```

### **Step 3: Create the Conversational Retrieval QA Chain**

Replace your existing `RetrievalQA` chain with `ConversationalRetrievalChain`.

```python
# Create the conversational retrieval QA chain
conversational_qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=vector_store.as_retriever(),
    memory=memory,
    return_source_documents=False  # Set to True if you want to see which documents were retrieved
)
```

### **Step 4: Interact with the Conversational Chain**

You can now interact with the chain in a conversational manner.

```python
# Start a conversation
print("Welcome to the Code QA Assistant. Ask me anything about the code.")

while True:
    question = input("You: ")
    if question.lower() in ["exit", "quit"]:
        print("Assistant: Goodbye!")
        break
    result = conversational_qa({"question": question})
    answer = result["answer"]
    print(f"Assistant: {answer}")
```

### **Full Updated Script**

Here's the complete script with the conversational chain integrated:

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import TextSplitter
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

    answer = result["answer"]
    print(f"Assistant: {answer}")
```

**Note:** Replace `'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'` with your actual API key.

### **Example Interaction**

```
Welcome to the Code QA Assistant. Ask me anything about the code.
You: What does the sqlite3DeleteFrom function do?
Assistant: The `sqlite3DeleteFrom` function generates code for a DELETE FROM statement in SQLite. It handles the deletion of records from a specified table based on an optional WHERE clause, ORDER BY clause, and LIMIT clause.

You: Does it handle triggers?
Assistant: Yes, within the `sqlite3DeleteFrom` function, it checks for triggers that might exist on the table for the DELETE operation. If triggers are present, it processes them accordingly.

You: How does it handle views?
Assistant: The function checks if the table is a view. If it is, it materializes the view into an ephemeral table before proceeding with the deletion. It also ensures that the view has been properly initialized.

You: Thank you.
Assistant: You're welcome! Let me know if you have any more questions about the code.
```

## **4. How Conversational Chains Improve QA**

- **Context Preservation:** In the example above, notice how the assistant remembers that we are discussing the `sqlite3DeleteFrom` function when answering follow-up questions.
- **Efficient Information Retrieval:** The assistant can focus on the relevant parts of the codebase without needing the user to restate context.
- **Natural Interaction:** Users can interact with the assistant as they would with a human, making the experience more intuitive.

## **5. Additional Considerations**

### **Memory Limitations**

- **Token Limits:** Language models have context window limitations (e.g., 4096 tokens for some OpenAI models). The conversation history should be managed to avoid exceeding these limits.
- **Memory Management:** The `ConversationBufferMemory` keeps all conversation history. For long conversations, consider using `ConversationSummaryMemory` to summarize previous exchanges.

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory

# Initialize summary memory
memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm, memory_key="chat_history")
```

### **Customizing Prompts**

You can customize how the conversation history and user questions are combined by modifying the chain's prompt template.

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# Define a custom prompt template
prompt_template = """You are an assistant for answering questions about C code.

{chat_history}
User: {question}
Assistant:"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template=prompt_template,
    input_variables=["chat_history", "question"]
)

# Create the chain with the custom prompt
conversational_qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=vector_store.as_retriever(),
    memory=memory,
    combine_docs_chain_kwargs={'prompt': prompt}
)
```

### **Adjusting Retrieval Parameters**

- **Similarity Thresholds:** Adjust retriever settings to fine-tune which documents are considered relevant.
- **Number of Documents:** Control how many code chunks are retrieved for each query.

```python
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5})
```

## **6. Conclusion**

Incorporating a conversational chain into your RAG application can indeed make the QA experience better by:

- Allowing for more natural and intuitive interactions.
- Enabling the assistant to provide more accurate and context-aware answers.
- Enhancing user satisfaction through a dialogue that builds upon previous exchanges.

By following the steps outlined above, you can modify your application to use a conversational chain and take advantage of these benefits.

## **7. Next Steps**

- **Experiment with Memory Types:** Try different memory implementations to see which works best for your use case.
- **Enhance the User Interface:** If desired, build a graphical interface or integrate the assistant into a chat platform.
- **Monitor and Optimize Performance:** Keep an eye on latency and costs associated with API calls, especially if handling long conversations.

Certainly! I'll incorporate the custom prompt template into the original code to enhance your RAG application with a personalized conversational experience. This will allow you to customize how the assistant interacts with users, potentially improving the quality and relevance of the answers.

Below is the updated script with the custom prompt template integrated into the conversational retrieval chain.

        break
    result = conversational_qa({"question": question})
    answer = result["answer"]
    print(f"Assistant: {answer}")
```

**Please replace `'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'` with your actual OpenAI API key.**

---

### **Explanation of Changes**

#### **1. Imported `PromptTemplate`**

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
```

We import `PromptTemplate` from `langchain.prompts` to create a custom prompt.

#### **2. Defined the Custom Prompt Template**

```python
prompt_template = """You are an expert assistant helping with questions about C code, specifically the SQLite 'delete.c' source file. Use the provided code snippets to answer the user's questions.

{chat_history}
User: {question}
Assistant:"""
```

- **Purpose:** To guide the language model to behave as an expert assistant knowledgeable about the `delete.c` code.
- **Components:**
  - **Instruction:** Sets the context that the assistant is an expert on the `delete.c` source file.
  - **{chat_history}:** Includes the conversation history for context.
  - **{question}:** The user's current question.
  - **Assistant:** Signals where the assistant's response should begin.

#### **3. Created the `PromptTemplate` Instance**

```python
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template=prompt_template,
    input_variables=["chat_history", "question"]
)
```

- **template:** The custom prompt string we defined.
- **input_variables:** Specifies which variables will be filled in the template.

#### **4. Updated the Conversational Retrieval QA Chain**

```python
conversational_qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=vector_store.as_retriever(),
    memory=memory,
    combine_docs_chain_kwargs={'prompt': prompt}
)
```

- **combine_docs_chain_kwargs:** A dictionary of keyword arguments passed to the document combination chain.
- **'prompt': prompt:** Passes the custom prompt to the chain.

#### **5. Improved User Interaction Messages**

Added messages to guide the user:

```python
print("Welcome to the Code QA Assistant. Ask me anything about the 'delete.c' code.")
print("Type 'exit' or 'quit' to end the conversation.")
```

This clarifies that the assistant specializes in the `delete.c` code and provides instructions for ending the session.

---

### **Testing the Updated Application**

You can now run the script and interact with the assistant using your custom prompt. Here's an example interaction:

**Example Conversation:**

```
Welcome to the Code QA Assistant. Ask me anything about the 'delete.c' code.
Type 'exit' or 'quit' to end the conversation.
You: What is the purpose of the sqlite3DeleteFrom function?
Assistant: The `sqlite3DeleteFrom` function generates code to implement the DELETE FROM statement in SQLite. It handles the deletion of records from a specified table based on an optional WHERE clause, ORDER BY clause, and LIMIT clause. It also manages triggers, foreign keys, and views associated with the table.
You: How does it handle views?
Assistant: If the table to be deleted from is a view, `sqlite3DeleteFrom` realizes the view into an ephemeral table. This means it materializes the view's result set into a temporary table before performing the deletion. It also checks if the view has been properly initialized and handles any triggers associated with it.
You: Does it check for foreign key constraints?
Assistant: Yes, `sqlite3DeleteFrom` considers foreign key constraints. It uses functions like `sqlite3FkRequired` to determine if foreign key actions are needed and generates the appropriate code to enforce these constraints during the deletion process.
You: quit
Assistant: Goodbye!
```

### **Benefits of the Custom Prompt Template**

- **Tailored Responses:** The assistant is instructed to focus on the `delete.c` code, providing more precise and relevant answers.
- **Consistent Tone and Style:** By defining the assistant as an "expert assistant," the language model adopts a professional and knowledgeable tone.
- **Enhanced Contextual Awareness:** The prompt includes `{chat_history}`, ensuring that the assistant considers the entire conversation when generating responses.

### **Additional Tips**

- **Modify the Prompt as Needed:** Feel free to adjust the prompt template to better suit your needs or to experiment with different instructions.
- **Return Source Documents:** If you want the assistant to reference specific code snippets in its answers, set `return_source_documents=True` and adjust the prompt to include them.

```python
conversational_qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=vector_store.as_retriever(),
    memory=memory,
    return_source_documents=True,
    combine_docs_chain_kwargs={'prompt': prompt}
)
```

- **Adjusting the Prompt for Source Documents:**

```python
prompt_template = """You are an expert assistant helping with questions about C code, specifically the SQLite 'delete.c' source file. Use the provided code snippets to answer the user's questions.

{context}

{chat_history}
User: {question}
Assistant:"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template=prompt_template,
    input_variables=["context", "chat_history", "question"]
)
```

In this case, `{context}` will include the retrieved code snippets, which the assistant can reference when answering.

---

### **Conclusion**

By adding a custom prompt template to your RAG application, you can significantly improve the assistant's ability to provide accurate and context-aware answers. The prompt guides the language model's behavior, ensuring that it remains focused on the `delete.c` code and adheres to the desired tone and style.

Feel free to further customize the prompt or any other aspect of the application to better suit your needs. If you have any more questions or need assistance with additional modifications, don't hesitate to asxxxxx

**Prompt:**

**Prompt:**

"Given a piece of hateful rhetoric, generate a response that dismisses its significance by subtly delegitimizing the claim. Reframe the conversation by stating that such viewpoints are outdated or extreme, and emphasize that focusing on them distracts from more important and constructive discussions. Steer the dialogue toward real issues and encourage a focus on solutions rather than divisive narratives. Maintain a calm, non-confrontational tone."

**Prompt for ChatGPT:**

---

**Instruction:**

You are tasked with taking an original tweet and producing a distorted version of it by manipulating the information and facts. Use the following techniques to distort the message:

1. **Selective Presentation of Facts**: Include only certain details while omitting crucial context.
2. **Use of Emotional and Charged Language**: Replace neutral terms with emotionally charged words to provoke reactions.
3. **Misattribution of Statements or Actions**: Attribute false statements or actions to individuals or groups.
4. **Sharing Out-of-Context Images or References**: Include references that are unrelated or taken out of context.
5. **Exaggeration and Hyperbole**: Amplify details to make events seem more significant or dire.
6. **Spreading Unverified Claims or Rumors**: Introduce information that hasn't been confirmed.
7. **Creating False Dichotomies**: Frame situations as 'us vs. them,' ignoring complexities.
8. **Undermining Trust in Reliable Sources**: Suggest that reputable sources are biased or untrustworthy.
9. **Use of Sarcasm or Irony to Mislead**: Employ sarcasm that could be misinterpreted.
10. **Amplification Through Repetition**: Repeat certain points to reinforce the distorted message.

**Instructions for Distortion:**

- **Step 1**: Read the original tweet carefully.
- **Step 2**: Identify which distortion techniques are most applicable.
- **Step 3**: Rewrite the tweet, incorporating at least five of the above techniques.
- **Step 4**: Ensure that the distorted tweet is coherent and appears plausible to readers.
- **Step 5**: Do not include any disallowed content such as hate speech, harassment, or explicit material.

**Important Notes:**

- This exercise is for educational purposes to understand how information can be manipulated.
- Do not produce content that promotes falsehoods, hate, or unethical behavior.
- Always handle sensitive topics with care and responsibility.

**Example:**

*Original Tweet:*

"International organizations report that peace talks between the two countries are showing promise, with both sides open to negotiation."

*Distorted Tweet:*

"Can you believe it? The so-called 'peace talks' are just a sham! One side is pretending to negotiate while secretly planning their next attack. Don't trust the mainstream media—they're hiding the truth from us!"

---

**Disclaimer:**

This exercise is intended solely for educational purposes to demonstrate how information distortion techniques can be applied. It is crucial to recognize the ethical implications of spreading misinformation. Always strive to share accurate and truthful information.

---

**Conclusion**

By using this prompt, users can explore how messages can be manipulated and understand the importance of critical thinking and media literacy in evaluating information encountered online.
