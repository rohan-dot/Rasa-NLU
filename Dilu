Below is an example prompt you can provide to your local LLM. It includes an outline of the steps (thinking method) the model should follow, a “few-shot” style demonstration of the desired output, and the essential instructions. Adapt it to your environment or style as needed.

## Prompt: Identify Vulnerabilities in `http.c` Without Adding New Bugs

**System/Developer Instruction**:
You are analyzing a C code file (`http.c`) for possible security or reliability vulnerabilities. Your primary tasks:

1. **Identify** potentially weak or vulnerable areas in the code (e.g., unchecked buffer sizes, boundary issues, unvalidated input, risky memory usage, etc.).
2. **Explain** why each flagged item could be a risk.
3. **Do not** suggest or show how to create or insert new bugs.
4. **Do not** break or remove functionality—just point out concerns and weaknesses.

---

### Thinking Method

Follow this approach step-by-step:
1. **Scan the code** for places that process data from external sources (e.g., network, user input).
2. **Check** for integer overflow, out-of-bounds array usage, unchecked memory operations, or string handling with no length verification.
3. **Inspect** authentication/authorization flows for any potential misuse.
4. **Note** any areas where function return values aren’t checked but should be.
5. **Summarize** each suspicious location or function with a short rationale.

### Desired Output Format

- A **numbered list** or set of “Potential Issue #X” entries.  
- Each entry includes:
  - **Location**: function name or approximate line numbers.
  - **Explanation**: why it might be a vulnerability or could fail under certain conditions.

**Example** (fictional illustration):

```
Potential Issue #1
Function: http_readwrite_headers (Lines ~320–350)
Explanation: The function copies data into 'headerb' without checking the maximum size. This could lead to a buffer overflow if 'headerb' is not large enough to hold all incoming header lines.

Potential Issue #2
Function: Curl_http_auth_act (Lines ~600–630)
Explanation: The code sets 'newurl' based on user input without validating its length. A malicious user could potentially force an out-of-bounds write if there's insufficient boundary checking.
```

*(Note: These examples are illustrative. Please provide only the actual issues found in the real `http.c`.)*

### Important Reminders
- **Do not** propose how to exploit or insert new bugs; only identify existing weaknesses.
- If certain sections are secure or do not appear vulnerable, skip them.
- Keep your analysis concise and technical.

We did not showcase impersonation results on the Twitter dataset due to potential **data leakage** concerns. Since **LLMs are trained on large-scale web data, including social media content**, they may have already **internalized a celebrity’s writing style**, making it an **unreliable test for our RAG-based approach**. Such overlap could inflate performance metrics, **undermining the validity of our evaluation**.






### 4 Methodology

In this section, we describe our approach for **LLM-based author impersonation** using the **STRAP (Style Transfer via Paraphrasing)** framework combined with fine-tuned language models. Our methodology is designed to preserve the semantic integrity of the original text while effectively transferring the stylistic elements of a target author. The pipeline involves four key stages: paraphrasing, fine-tuning, style imputation, and verification.

#### 4.1 Paraphrasing with STRAP

The first step in our pipeline employs the **STRAP framework** to generate paraphrased versions of both the source and target author documents. STRAP reformulates unsupervised style transfer as a paraphrase generation task, where the style of a given sentence is modified without significantly altering its meaning. This process involves feeding the original sentences through a **diverse paraphrase model** to create **pseudo-parallel datasets**. The paraphrased outputs serve to **normalize stylistic elements**, effectively stripping identifiable authorial traits while maintaining semantic coherence.

#### 4.2 Fine-tuning GPT-2 for Style Transfer

Once the paraphrased documents are generated, we use them alongside their original counterparts to **fine-tune a GPT-2 model**. This fine-tuning process is crucial as it enables the model to learn the relationship between neutral, paraphrased text and its corresponding author-specific style. The GPT-2 model is trained to **reintroduce stylistic features** that are characteristic of the target author, focusing on elements such as **lexical choices, syntactic structures, and tone**. By leveraging both paraphrased and original text pairs, the model becomes proficient in embedding the target author's style into previously neutralized content.

#### 4.3 Style Imputation on Source Text

After fine-tuning, the GPT-2 model is applied to the paraphrased source documents. This step, referred to as **style imputation**, involves transforming the neutral source text to adopt the stylistic features of the target author. The goal is to create a text that is **stylistically indistinguishable from the target author’s writing** while preserving the original semantic content. This process effectively achieves **targeted adversarial impersonation**, where the writing style of the target author is transferred onto the source content.

#### 4.4 Verification Using BigBird

The final stage of our methodology involves verifying the success of the impersonation using **MIT Lincoln Laboratory's BigBird** model, a robust **authorship verification (AV) system**. BigBird is utilized to evaluate whether the transformed text convincingly mimics the target author's style. The model assesses the stylistic and structural properties of the generated text to determine if it can **successfully flip a False Trial (FT) into a True Trial (TT)**, meaning the impersonated text is classified as being authored by the target author. This verification step is critical for assessing the **effectiveness and robustness** of our impersonation pipeline.

This methodology integrates **semantic-preserving paraphrasing** with **style-specific fine-tuning** to achieve high-fidelity authorship impersonation, demonstrating the vulnerabilities of existing AV models to sophisticated LLM-driven adversarial attacks.
