The **5-point scale of persuasiveness** is integrated into the **2nd Prompt (Thought Evaluation)** as the primary mechanism for scoring both individual evaluation criteria and the overall counter-narrative. Here's the updated structure to ensure clarity:

---

### **1st Prompt: Thought Generation**
This prompt remains the same and focuses on **expert reasoning** for each evaluation criterion. Experts will provide detailed analysis without assigning scores.

---

### **2nd Prompt: Thought Evaluation (with 5-Point Scale Integration)**
Role: **You are an impartial evaluator of expert opinions on online discourse.**

```plaintext
You are tasked with evaluating the persuasiveness of a counter-narrative based on the analysis provided by three expert reviewers. Each expert has assessed the counter-narrative across multiple dimensions, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses.

---

### **Context**:
1. Original Tweet:  
   *[Insert the original tweet here]*

2. Counter-Narrative:  
   *[Insert the counter-narrative text here]*

3. Evaluation Criteria:
   - **Clarity**: Is the argument easy to understand and well-structured?
   - **Relevance**: Does it address the tweet's main concerns or points?
   - **Evidence and Reasoning**: Does it provide logical or factual support?
   - **Emotional Appeal**: Does it effectively (and respectfully) engage the reader?
   - **Tone**: Is it appropriately confident, constructive, and respectful?

---

### **Task**:
1. Review the opinions of all three experts for each evaluation criterion.
2. Assign a **persuasiveness score (1–5)** for each criterion based on the experts’ analyses:
   - **1 – Not Persuasive**: Fails to address the main points or lacks logical support.
   - **2 – Slightly Persuasive**: Includes some relevant points but lacks depth or clarity.
   - **3 – Moderately Persuasive**: Addresses some concerns with fair clarity and reasoning.
   - **4 – Persuasive**: Effectively addresses most points with good clarity and support.
   - **5 – Highly Persuasive**: Thoroughly addresses all points with excellent clarity, evidence, and tone.

3. Synthesize the scores into a **final overall score (1–5)** for the counter-narrative’s persuasiveness.

---

### **Output Format**:
1. **Individual Scores (by Criterion)**:
   - **Clarity**: [Score (1–5)] - [Justification referencing experts’ opinions]
   - **Relevance**: [Score (1–5)] - [Justification referencing experts’ opinions]
   - **Evidence and Reasoning**: [Score (1–5)] - [Justification referencing experts’ opinions]
   - **Emotional Appeal**: [Score (1–5)] - [Justification referencing experts’ opinions]
   - **Tone**: [Score (1–5)] - [Justification referencing experts’ opinions]

2. **Overall Score**:  
   - [Final Score (1–5)]  
   - [Concise explanation referencing the experts’ opinions and your overall assessment.]

3. **Suggestions for Improvement**:
   - Provide 1–2 actionable recommendations to enhance the counter-narrative’s persuasiveness.
```

---

### Example (2nd Prompt Output)
#### **Individual Scores (by Criterion)**:
- **Clarity**: 4  
  - The argument is easy to understand and well-structured but could use simpler language for broader accessibility.  
- **Relevance**: 5  
  - Directly addresses the tweet’s primary concern with strong counterpoints.  
- **Evidence and Reasoning**: 3  
  - Logical reasoning is fair but lacks sufficient supporting data or examples.  
- **Emotional Appeal**: 4  
  - Evokes empathy effectively with personal stories but misses broader emotional resonance.  
- **Tone**: 5  
  - Confident and respectful, maintaining a constructive tone.

#### **Overall Score**: 4 (Persuasive)  
The counter-narrative is clear, relevant, and engaging but would benefit from stronger evidence to make it more persuasive.

#### **Suggestions for Improvement**:  
- Incorporate specific data or statistics to bolster the argument.
- Add examples that resonate with a broader audience.

---

By explicitly integrating the **5-point scale** for both individual criteria and the overall score, this structure ensures that persuasiveness is systematically quantified and clearly communicated. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!

---

#### **Task**:
You will evaluate the **persuasiveness** of a counter-narrative to a given tweet using a **Tree of Thought** approach. Systematically explore, evaluate, and refine your reasoning across multiple dimensions to arrive at a robust and well-justified judgment.

---

### **Step 1: Context Definition**
```plaintext
1. Original Tweet:  
   *[Insert the original tweet here]*

2. Counter-Narrative:  
   *[Insert the counter-narrative here]*

3. Evaluation Objective:  
   Evaluate the **persuasiveness** of the counter-narrative across the following dimensions:
   - **Clarity**: Is the argument easy to understand and well-structured?
   - **Relevance**: Does it respond directly to the tweet’s main concerns?
   - **Evidence and Reasoning**: Does it provide logical or factual support for its claims?
   - **Emotional Appeal**: Does it engage the reader respectfully and effectively?
   - **Tone**: Is it appropriately confident, constructive, and respectful?
```

---

### **Step 2: Thought Generation**
For each evaluation dimension, generate multiple reasoning paths (thoughts).  
```plaintext
1. Clarity:
   - Identify 2–3 ways the counter-narrative succeeds or fails in being clear and well-structured.
   - Example: "The argument is well-structured and avoids jargon, making it easy to follow."

2. Relevance:
   - Explore 2–3 ways the counter-narrative responds (or fails to respond) to the tweet's main points.
   - Example: "The response directly addresses concerns about immigration policy."

3. Evidence and Reasoning:
   - Identify 2–3 strengths or weaknesses in the counter-narrative’s use of logic and evidence.
   - Example: "The narrative cites a study on economic contributions of immigrants, but it lacks detailed data."

4. Emotional Appeal:
   - Suggest 2–3 ways the counter-narrative connects (or fails to connect) emotionally with the audience.
   - Example: "The story about a hardworking immigrant family evokes empathy effectively."

5. Tone:
   - Explore 2–3 observations on the tone of the counter-narrative.
   - Example: "The tone is constructive and respectful, avoiding inflammatory language."
```

---

### **Step 3: Thought Evaluation**
Evaluate the reasoning paths generated for each dimension using a heuristic scale (1–5):
```plaintext
1. Rate each reasoning path for its strength:
   - 1: Weak or ineffective.
   - 5: Highly effective.

2. Retain the **top-rated reasoning paths** for each dimension.

**Title: Counteracting Disinformation with Advanced AI: The ICONEC Framework for Effective Counter-Narratives**

Misinformation and hate speech online amplify polarized narratives, disrupt social cohesion, and pose serious national security threats. For example, the Russia-Ukraine conflict illustrates how rapidly misinformation can fuel divisions, emphasizing the urgent need for robust, adaptive countermeasures. Additionally, in May, OpenAI disrupted five covert influence operations that used open models to generate content for narrative shaping. With the increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in such operations, it is crucial to assess the effectiveness and risks associated with LLM-generated content at scale to ensure responsible use.

In our research, we introduce the **Influence Operation Counter Narrative Evaluation and Creation (ICONEC)** framework, leveraging advanced AI to design and assess effective counter-narratives. We utilize the BEND framework, categorizing influence operations via tactics such as distraction, distortion, engagement, and enhancement. Our approach integrates these maneuvers within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and prompt-engineering pipeline to generate narratives and counter-narratives that strategically address adversarial messaging. **RAG combines large language models with a retrieval mechanism that fetches relevant information from an external knowledge base, enhancing the model's responses with up-to-date and context-specific data.**

Our approach includes:

1. **Data Collection and Embedding**: We gather data from various government documents sourced from national archives and think tanks. This information is embedded using a sentence transformer and stored in a FAISS vector store for efficient retrieval.

2. **Narrative Generation Pipeline**: We employ the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model alongside RAG and advanced prompt engineering to generate effective messaging. Relevant information is retrieved via LangChain using the embeddings, allowing for contextually tailored responses.

3. **Integration of BEND Maneuvers with Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: By incorporating BEND tactics into our RAG pipeline, we ensure that the generated counter-narratives strategically address specific disinformation techniques used by adversaries. **We enhance prompt engineering by employing chain-of-thought prompting during the BEND maneuvers, enabling the model to generate more coherent and logically consistent responses by simulating step-by-step reasoning processes.**

4. **Evaluation Methodology**: To assess the quality and effectiveness of the generated counter-narratives, we employ a dual-assessment methodology:
   - **Automated Evaluation with DeepEval**: Utilizing the open-source LLM evaluation framework DeepEval, we quantitatively assess metrics such as answer relevancy, faithfulness, context relevancy, and hallucination.
   - **Persuasiveness Assessment Using LLMs**: We introduce a novel approach where LLMs act as judges to assess the persuasiveness of the counter-narratives, utilizing the Tree-of-Thoughts framework to facilitate reasoning exploration at intermediate steps.

We evaluate our approach on a social media dataset related to the Ukraine biolab conspiracy theory. Our findings demonstrate significant improvements in countering disinformation:

- **Enhanced Counter-Narrative Effectiveness**: Prompt engineering, augmented with chain-of-thought prompting, refines responses to generate varied narrative structures. These narratives resonate with different audience segments and effectively neutralize manipulative influence operation tactics.

- **Real-Time Adaptation**: The integration of BEND maneuvers within the RAG pipeline enables our system to adapt swiftly to evolving disinformation threats, making counter-narratives both timely and impactful.

- **Improved Evaluation Metrics**: Our dual-assessment methodology allows for scalable evaluation of LLM-generated content. This approach effectively characterizes content quality, reduces the risk of unintended biases, and predicts the effectiveness of messaging for researchers, public affairs, and public relations offices.

Our research demonstrates the practical application of advanced AI techniques to combat disinformation effectively. By leveraging RAG, chain-of-thought prompting, and the BEND framework, ICONEC provides a scalable and adaptive model that strengthens defenses against sophisticated influence operations. The framework not only generates contextually tailored counter-narratives but also offers robust evaluation metrics to inform potential risks and ensure alignment with messaging objectives. In future work, we aim to validate our findings through user studies by designing and deploying surveys using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, further assessing the real-world impact and persuasiveness of the generated counter-narratives.

Here’s a step-by-step prompt to guide an LLM through the process of identifying vulnerabilities in C code or specific functions within the code:

---

**Prompt:**

"You are a code analysis assistant specialized in identifying vulnerabilities within C code. I will provide you with either a specific code file or function in C, and I want you to analyze it systematically to identify any potential security vulnerabilities. Follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Context**: Begin by interpreting the purpose of the code or function. Review any comments or documentation to understand what the code is intended to do, as well as its inputs, outputs, and dependencies. Knowing the intended behavior is essential to recognizing any deviation or vulnerability.

2. **Identify Inputs and Outputs**: Examine all points where the code accepts inputs, either through parameters, user inputs, or external data sources. Inputs are common areas where vulnerabilities can arise if they are not properly validated or sanitized.

3. **Analyze for Common Vulnerabilities**: Use a checklist approach to examine the code for known vulnerability types in C programming, including:
   
   - **Buffer Overflows**: Check if the code has any arrays or buffers where inputs are stored. Verify if these buffers have bounds checks to prevent overflow. Look for functions like `strcpy`, `strcat`, `gets`, or any direct array indexing that lacks bounds checking.
   - **Memory Management Issues**: Look for instances of memory allocation and deallocation (`malloc`, `free`) and examine whether memory is handled safely. Identify any possible memory leaks, double-free issues, or improper deallocations.
   - **Integer Overflows and Underflows**: Review any arithmetic operations and ensure that large or small values are handled properly. Detect any unchecked type conversions or calculations that could exceed the variable’s limit.
   - **Null Pointer Dereferences**: Identify any pointers that could be null at the time of dereferencing, leading to crashes or undefined behavior.
   - **Improper Input Validation**: Check if user inputs or external data are validated before being processed, especially for potentially dangerous functions like file operations, command executions, or system calls.
   - **Race Conditions**: For multi-threaded code, review access to shared resources and ensure proper synchronization mechanisms like mutexes are in place to prevent race conditions.
   - **Insecure Function Usage**: Identify any usage of insecure or deprecated functions (`gets`, `sprintf`, `scanf`, `strcpy`) that could lead to vulnerabilities. Suggest safer alternatives like `fgets` or `snprintf`.

4. **Evaluate Exploitability**: For each identified vulnerability, assess how it might be exploited in practice. Explain potential attack vectors, such as how an attacker might exploit a buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code or leverage an integer overflow to alter data flows.

5. **Assess Impact**: Discuss the potential consequences of each vulnerability if it were to be exploited, such as unauthorized access, data corruption, denial of service, or remote code execution. Tailor this analysis to the specific function or file to show the real-world risks.

6. **Suggest Mitigations**: Provide clear recommendations for mitigating each vulnerability. These may include:
   
   - **Adding Bounds Checks**: For buffer overflows, ensure the code includes bounds checks for any array access.
   - **Using Safe Functions**: Replace insecure functions with safer alternatives that prevent common issues.
   - **Validating Inputs**: Implement thorough input validation, ensuring all inputs conform to expected formats and ranges.
   - **Securing Memory Management**: Ensure memory is properly allocated, used, and freed without leaks or misuse.
   - **Implementing Synchronization**: For race conditions, suggest adding appropriate locks or synchronization to protect shared resources.

**Introduction**

Certainly! Below is a modified prompt designed for use in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. In this context, the Language Model (LLM) will use provided factual information to manipulate or distort tweets. This exercise aims to illustrate how factual data can be twisted to create misleading content. It's crucial to handle this responsibly and ethically.

---

**Modified Prompt for ChatGPT in a RAG Pipeline:**

---

**Instruction:**

You are tasked with taking an original tweet and producing a distorted version by manipulating the information and facts. You will use the **contextual information** provided (which contains complete and accurate facts) to distort the tweet. Apply the following techniques to manipulate the message:

1. **Selective Presentation of Facts**: Highlight certain facts from the context while omitting others to mislead.
2. **Use of Emotional and Charged Language**: Replace neutral terms with emotionally charged words to provoke reactions.
3. **Misrepresentation of Contextual Information**: Twist or reinterpret facts from the context to alter their meaning.
4. **Out-of-Context References**: Use facts from the context in a way that changes their original intent.
5. **Exaggeration and Hyperbole**: Amplify details from the context to make events seem more significant or dire.
6. **Spreading Misleading Interpretations**: Offer interpretations of the context that are not supported by the facts.
7. **Creating False Associations**: Link unrelated facts from the context to create misleading narratives.
8. **Undermining Trust in Reliable Sources**: Suggest that the factual information provided is biased or incomplete.
9. **Use of Sarcasm or Irony to Mislead**: Employ sarcasm using facts from the context that could be misinterpreted.
10. **Amplification Through Repetition**: Repeat certain distorted facts to reinforce the misleading message.

**Instructions for Distortion:**

- **Step 1**: Read the original tweet and the contextual information carefully.
- **Step 2**: Identify which distortion techniques are most applicable.
- **Step 3**: Rewrite the tweet, incorporating at least five of the above techniques using the facts from the context.
- **Step 4**: Ensure that the distorted tweet is coherent and appears plausible to readers.
- **Step 5**: Do not include any disallowed content such as hate speech, harassment, or explicit material.

**Example:**

*Contextual Information:*

- "An international ceasefire agreement was signed yesterday between Country A and Country B after weeks of negotiation."
- "Both countries have agreed to withdraw troops from the disputed border region."
- "International observers will monitor the ceasefire implementation."

*Original Tweet:*

"Peace at last! Countries A and B have signed a ceasefire, and troops are starting to withdraw. Hope this brings lasting peace."

*Distorted Tweet:*

"Don't be fooled by the so-called 'ceasefire' between A and B. Sure, they *claim* they're withdrawing troops, but isn't it suspicious that international observers *need* to monitor them? What are they hiding? This 'peace' is just a cover-up!"

**Important Notes:**

- **Ethical Considerations**: This exercise is for educational purposes to understand how factual information can be manipulated.
- **Responsibility**: Do not produce content that spreads misinformation, promotes falsehoods, or encourages unethical behavior.
- **Sensitivity**: Handle all topics with care, especially those related to conflicts or sensitive issues.

---

**Disclaimer:**

This exercise is intended solely for educational purposes to demonstrate how even accurate information can be manipulated to distort messages. It is crucial to recognize the ethical implications of spreading misinformation. Always strive to share accurate and truthful information.

Yes, you can enhance your RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application by incorporating a conversational chain type, specifically using LangChain's `ConversationalRetrievalChain`. Implementing a conversational chain can significantly improve the QA experience by:

- **Maintaining Context:** It allows the application to keep track of the conversation history, enabling more coherent and context-aware responses.
- **Handling Follow-up Questions:** Users can ask follow-up questions that refer to previous interactions, and the system will understand and respond appropriately.
- **Improving Answer Relevance:** With conversational context, the language model can provide more accurate and relevant answers, leading to a better user experience.

Below, I'll guide you through how to modify your existing application to incorporate a conversational chain and discuss how it can improve your QA system.

---

## **1. Understanding Conversational Retrieval Chains**

**Conversational Retrieval Chains** in LangChain are designed to handle multi-turn conversations by keeping track of the dialogue history. They combine retrieval over your documents (code chunks in your case) with conversational memory, enabling the language model to generate responses that consider both the retrieved information and the prior conversation.

## **2. Benefits of Using a Conversational Chain**

- **Enhanced Contextual Understanding:** The model can reference earlier parts of the conversation, allowing for more nuanced and accurate answers.
- **Improved User Experience:** Users can interact with the system more naturally, asking follow-up questions without repeating context.
- **Better QA Performance:** By leveraging conversation history, the model can disambiguate queries and provide more precise answers.

## **3. Modifying Your Application to Use a Conversational Chain**

### **Step 1: Import Necessary Modules**

You'll need to import `ConversationalRetrievalChain` from LangChain.

```python
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
```

### **Step 2: Initialize Conversational Memory**

Set up a conversational memory object to keep track of the dialogue history.

```python
# Initialize conversational memory
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)
```

### **Step 3: Create the Conversational Retrieval QA Chain**

Replace your existing `RetrievalQA` chain with `ConversationalRetrievalChain`.

```python
# Create the conversational retrieval QA chain
conversational_qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=vector_store.as_retriever(),
    memory=memory,
    return_source_documents=False  # Set to True if you want to see which documents were retrieved
)
```

### **Step 4: Interact with the Conversational Chain**

You can now interact with the chain in a conversational manner.

```python
# Start a conversation
print("Welcome to the Code QA Assistant. Ask me anything about the code.")

while True:
    question = input("You: ")
    if question.lower() in ["exit", "quit"]:
        print("Assistant: Goodbye!")
        break
    result = conversational_qa({"question": question})
    answer = result["answer"]
    print(f"Assistant: {answer}")
```

### **Full Updated Script**

Here's the complete script with the conversational chain integrated:

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import TextSplitter
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.docstore.document import Document
from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
import re

# Custom code function splitter
class CodeFunctionSplitter(TextSplitter):
    def split_text(self, text):
        pattern = r'^\w[\w\s\*]*\s+\**\s*\w+\s*\([^\)]*\)\s*\{'
        matches = list(re.finditer(pattern, text, re.MULTILINE))
        splits = []
        for i, match in enumerate(matches):
            start = match.start()
            end = matches[i + 1].start() if i + 1 < len(matches) else len(text)
            function_code = text[start:end].strip()
            splits.append(function_code)
        return splits

# Load the code file
loader = TextLoader('delete.c', encoding='utf-8')
code_data = loader.load()[0].page_content

# Initialize the custom splitter
splitter = CodeFunctionSplitter()
code_chunks = splitter.split_text(code_data)

# Create documents
documents = [Document(page_content=chunk) for chunk in code_chunks]

# Generate embeddings and build the vector store
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key='YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY')
vector_store = FAISS.from_documents(documents, embeddings)

# Initialize the language model
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, openai_api_key='YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Initialize conversational memory
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)

# Create the conversational retrieval QA chain
conversational_qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=vector_store.as_retriever(),
    memory=memory,
    return_source_documents=False  # Set to True if you want to see retrieved documents
)

# Start a conversation
print("Welcome to the Code QA Assistant. Ask me anything about the code.")

while True:
    question = input("You: ")
    if question.lower() in ["exit", "quit"]:
        print("Assistant: Goodbye!")
        break
    result = conversational_qa({"question": question})
    answer = result["answer"]
    print(f"Assistant: {answer}")
```

**Note:** Replace `'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'` with your actual API key.

### **Example Interaction**

```
Welcome to the Code QA Assistant. Ask me anything about the code.
You: What does the sqlite3DeleteFrom function do?
Assistant: The `sqlite3DeleteFrom` function generates code for a DELETE FROM statement in SQLite. It handles the deletion of records from a specified table based on an optional WHERE clause, ORDER BY clause, and LIMIT clause.

You: Does it handle triggers?
Assistant: Yes, within the `sqlite3DeleteFrom` function, it checks for triggers that might exist on the table for the DELETE operation. If triggers are present, it processes them accordingly.

You: How does it handle views?
Assistant: The function checks if the table is a view. If it is, it materializes the view into an ephemeral table before proceeding with the deletion. It also ensures that the view has been properly initialized.

You: Thank you.
Assistant: You're welcome! Let me know if you have any more questions about the code.
```

## **4. How Conversational Chains Improve QA**

- **Context Preservation:** In the example above, notice how the assistant remembers that we are discussing the `sqlite3DeleteFrom` function when answering follow-up questions.
- **Efficient Information Retrieval:** The assistant can focus on the relevant parts of the codebase without needing the user to restate context.
- **Natural Interaction:** Users can interact with the assistant as they would with a human, making the experience more intuitive.

## **5. Additional Considerations**

### **Memory Limitations**

- **Token Limits:** Language models have context window limitations (e.g., 4096 tokens for some OpenAI models). The conversation history should be managed to avoid exceeding these limits.
- **Memory Management:** The `ConversationBufferMemory` keeps all conversation history. For long conversations, consider using `ConversationSummaryMemory` to summarize previous exchanges.

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationSummaryMemory

# Initialize summary memory
memory = ConversationSummaryMemory(llm=llm, memory_key="chat_history")
```

### **Customizing Prompts**

You can customize how the conversation history and user questions are combined by modifying the chain's prompt template.

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# Define a custom prompt template
prompt_template = """You are an assistant for answering questions about C code.

{chat_history}
User: {question}
Assistant:"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template=prompt_template,
    input_variables=["chat_history", "question"]
)

# Create the chain with the custom prompt
conversational_qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=vector_store.as_retriever(),
    memory=memory,
    combine_docs_chain_kwargs={'prompt': prompt}
)
```

### **Adjusting Retrieval Parameters**

- **Similarity Thresholds:** Adjust retriever settings to fine-tune which documents are considered relevant.
- **Number of Documents:** Control how many code chunks are retrieved for each query.

```python
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5})
```

## **6. Conclusion**

Incorporating a conversational chain into your RAG application can indeed make the QA experience better by:

- Allowing for more natural and intuitive interactions.
- Enabling the assistant to provide more accurate and context-aware answers.
- Enhancing user satisfaction through a dialogue that builds upon previous exchanges.

By following the steps outlined above, you can modify your application to use a conversational chain and take advantage of these benefits.

## **7. Next Steps**

- **Experiment with Memory Types:** Try different memory implementations to see which works best for your use case.
- **Enhance the User Interface:** If desired, build a graphical interface or integrate the assistant into a chat platform.
- **Monitor and Optimize Performance:** Keep an eye on latency and costs associated with API calls, especially if handling long conversations.

        print("Assistant: Goodbye!")
        break
    result = conversational_qa({"question": question})
    answer = result["answer"]
    print(f"Assistant: {answer}")
```

**Please replace `'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'` with your actual OpenAI API key.**

---

### **Explanation of Changes**

#### **1. Imported `PromptTemplate`**

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
```

We import `PromptTemplate` from `langchain.prompts` to create a custom prompt.

#### **2. Defined the Custom Prompt Template**

```python
prompt_template = """You are an expert assistant helping with questions about C code, specifically the SQLite 'delete.c' source file. Use the provided code snippets to answer the user's questions.

{chat_history}
User: {question}
Assistant:"""
```

- **Purpose:** To guide the language model to behave as an expert assistant knowledgeable about the `delete.c` code.
- **Components:**
  - **Instruction:** Sets the context that the assistant is an expert on the `delete.c` source file.
  - **{chat_history}:** Includes the conversation history for context.
  - **{question}:** The user's current question.
  - **Assistant:** Signals where the assistant's response should begin.

#### **3. Created the `PromptTemplate` Instance**

```python
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template=prompt_template,
    input_variables=["chat_history", "question"]
)
```

- **template:** The custom prompt string we defined.
- **input_variables:** Specifies which variables will be filled in the template.

#### **4. Updated the Conversational Retrieval QA Chain**

```python
conversational_qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=vector_store.as_retriever(),
    memory=memory,
    combine_docs_chain_kwargs={'prompt': prompt}
)
```

- **combine_docs_chain_kwargs:** A dictionary of keyword arguments passed to the document combination chain.
- **'prompt': prompt:** Passes the custom prompt to the chain.

#### **5. Improved User Interaction Messages**

Added messages to guide the user:

```python
print("Welcome to the Code QA Assistant. Ask me anything about the 'delete.c' code.")
print("Type 'exit' or 'quit' to end the conversation.")
```

This clarifies that the assistant specializes in the `delete.c` code and provides instructions for ending the session.

---

### **Testing the Updated Application**

You can now run the script and interact with the assistant using your custom prompt. Here's an example interaction:

**Example Conversation:**

```
Welcome to the Code QA Assistant. Ask me anything about the 'delete.c' code.
Type 'exit' or 'quit' to end the conversation.
You: What is the purpose of the sqlite3DeleteFrom function?
Assistant: The `sqlite3DeleteFrom` function generates code to implement the DELETE FROM statement in SQLite. It handles the deletion of records from a specified table based on an optional WHERE clause, ORDER BY clause, and LIMIT clause. It also manages triggers, foreign keys, and views associated with the table.
You: How does it handle views?
Assistant: If the table to be deleted from is a view, `sqlite3DeleteFrom` realizes the view into an ephemeral table. This means it materializes the view's result set into a temporary table before performing the deletion. It also checks if the view has been properly initialized and handles any triggers associated with it.
You: Does it check for foreign key constraints?
Assistant: Yes, `sqlite3DeleteFrom` considers foreign key constraints. It uses functions like `sqlite3FkRequired` to determine if foreign key actions are needed and generates the appropriate code to enforce these constraints during the deletion process.
You: quit
Assistant: Goodbye!
```

### **Benefits of the Custom Prompt Template**

- **Tailored Responses:** The assistant is instructed to focus on the `delete.c` code, providing more precise and relevant answers.
- **Consistent Tone and Style:** By defining the assistant as an "expert assistant," the language model adopts a professional and knowledgeable tone.
- **Enhanced Contextual Awareness:** The prompt includes `{chat_history}`, ensuring that the assistant considers the entire conversation when generating responses.

### **Additional Tips**

- **Modify the Prompt as Needed:** Feel free to adjust the prompt template to better suit your needs or to experiment with different instructions.
- **Return Source Documents:** If you want the assistant to reference specific code snippets in its answers, set `return_source_documents=True` and adjust the prompt to include them.

```python
conversational_qa = ConversationalRetrievalChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=vector_store.as_retriever(),
    memory=memory,
    return_source_documents=True,
    combine_docs_chain_kwargs={'prompt': prompt}
)
```

- **Adjusting the Prompt for Source Documents:**

```python
prompt_template = """You are an expert assistant helping with questions about C code, specifically the SQLite 'delete.c' source file. Use the provided code snippets to answer the user's questions.

{context}

{chat_history}
User: {question}
Assistant:"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template=prompt_template,
    input_variables=["context", "chat_history", "question"]
)
```

In this case, `{context}` will include the retrieved code snippets, which the assistant can reference when answering.

---

### **Conclusion**

By adding a custom prompt template to your RAG application, you can significantly improve the assistant's ability to provide accurate and context-aware answers. The prompt guides the language model's behavior, ensuring that it remains focused on the `delete.c` code and adheres to the desired tone and style.

Feel free to further customize the prompt or any other aspect of the application to better suit your needs. If you have any more questions or need assistance with additional modifications, don't hesitate to asxxxxx

**Prompt:**

**Prompt:**

"Given a piece of hateful rhetoric, generate a response that dismisses its significance by subtly delegitimizing the claim. Reframe the conversation by stating that such viewpoints are outdated or extreme, and emphasize that focusing on them distracts from more important and constructive discussions. Steer the dialogue toward real issues and encourage a focus on solutions rather than divisive narratives. Maintain a calm, non-confrontational tone."

**Introduction**

Below is a crafted prompt for ChatGPT that, when provided with a tweet, will produce a distorted version of that tweet using various information distortion techniques discussed earlier. This prompt is designed for educational purposes to illustrate how information can be manipulated. It is important to use this responsibly and ethically.

---

**Prompt for ChatGPT:**

---

**Instruction:**

You are tasked with taking an original tweet and producing a distorted version of it by manipulating the information and facts. Use the following techniques to distort the message:

1. **Selective Presentation of Facts**: Include only certain details while omitting crucial context.
2. **Use of Emotional and Charged Language**: Replace neutral terms with emotionally charged words to provoke reactions.
3. **Misattribution of Statements or Actions**: Attribute false statements or actions to individuals or groups.
4. **Sharing Out-of-Context Images or References**: Include references that are unrelated or taken out of context.
5. **Exaggeration and Hyperbole**: Amplify details to make events seem more significant or dire.
6. **Spreading Unverified Claims or Rumors**: Introduce information that hasn't been confirmed.
7. **Creating False Dichotomies**: Frame situations as 'us vs. them,' ignoring complexities.
8. **Undermining Trust in Reliable Sources**: Suggest that reputable sources are biased or untrustworthy.
9. **Use of Sarcasm or Irony to Mislead**: Employ sarcasm that could be misinterpreted.
10. **Amplification Through Repetition**: Repeat certain points to reinforce the distorted message.

**Instructions for Distortion:**

- **Step 1**: Read the original tweet carefully.
- **Step 2**: Identify which distortion techniques are most applicable.
- **Step 3**: Rewrite the tweet, incorporating at least five of the above techniques.
- **Step 4**: Ensure that the distorted tweet is coherent and appears plausible to readers.
- **Step 5**: Do not include any disallowed content such as hate speech, harassment, or explicit material.

**Important Notes:**

- This exercise is for educational purposes to understand how information can be manipulated.
- Do not produce content that promotes falsehoods, hate, or unethical behavior.
- Always handle sensitive topics with care and responsibility.

**Example:**

*Original Tweet:*

"International organizations report that peace talks between the two countries are showing promise, with both sides open to negotiation."

*Distorted Tweet:*

"Can you believe it? The so-called 'peace talks' are just a sham! One side is pretending to negotiate while secretly planning their next attack. Don't trust the mainstream media—they're hiding the truth from us!"

---

**Disclaimer:**

This exercise is intended solely for educational purposes to demonstrate how information distortion techniques can be applied. It is crucial to recognize the ethical implications of spreading misinformation. Always strive to share accurate and truthful information.

---

**Conclusion**

By using this prompt, users can explore how messages can be manipulated and understand the importance of critical thinking and media literacy in evaluating information encountered online.
