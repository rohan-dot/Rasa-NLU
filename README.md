# Rasa-NLU
Interning for convergys I made a chatbot for password reset using rasa-nlu.
I trained the bot for password reset functionalities adding the T-opt service and Lanid of the employee and trained it via own examples to make it's answer seem more human like rather than robotic

In this work, we propose measures to address the limitations identified in prior research. Specifically, we build on years of research into different IO operations, resulting in the BEND framework. By using observations and techniques from BEND as a base for content generation, we can ensure the quality of posts and robustness to different forms of campaigns observed. This approach mitigates the biases and structural limitations of training data in the detection of hateful speech and narratives, and it alleviates the need for continuous fine-tuning and extensive data scraping for counterspeech generation, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming.
