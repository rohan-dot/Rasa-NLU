# Rasa-NLU
Interning for convergys I made a chatbot for password reset using rasa-nlu.
I trained the bot for password reset functionalities adding the T-opt service and Lanid of the employee and trained it via own examples to make it's answer seem more human like rather than robotic



 The challenge of ensuring factual correctness in large language models (LLMs) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures is significantly compounded by difficulties in verifying the factual accuracy of their training datasets. Given the vast and heterogeneous nature of these datasets, it becomes nearly impossible to systematically evaluate and ensure the truthfulness of the information fed into the models during their training phase. This issue is not as prevalent in more traditional models where the scope and source of training data are more controlled and thus, more easily vetted for accuracy. This fundamental limitation underscores an urgent need for innovative approaches to scrutinize and enhance the reliability of training data, thereby improving the factual correctness of outputs from LLMs, especially in critical applications where factual integrity is paramount.
