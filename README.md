# Rasa-NLU
Interning for convergys I made a chatbot for password reset using rasa-nlu.
I trained the bot for password reset functionalities adding the T-opt service and Lanid of the employee and trained it via own examples to make it's answer seem more human like rather than robotic

### Introduction

Our team has partnered with a group focused on developing an advanced attack path planning capability. In the past, we utilized the DEPART database to associate cyber vulnerabilities with exploits. However, the current challenge necessitates a more sophisticated approach to map vulnerabilities to specific techniques, as their existing process is manual and relies solely on textual descriptions from both data sources.

To address this, we initiated the development of a CVE-to-Technique mapping system, designed to be integrated into their tool, COLE. This system will automatically suggest relevant techniques to users, reducing the need for manual entries. Manual processes typically limit users to techniques they are already familiar with, whereas our automated system will provide a more comprehensive and innovative range of possibilities.

### Difference between CVE and TTP

- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):**
  - CVE is a list of publicly disclosed information security vulnerabilities and exposures. Each CVE entry identifies a specific vulnerability or exposure in software, such as a flaw in code or a configuration error that can be exploited by attackers.
  - CVE entries provide standardized identifiers for vulnerabilities, allowing different security tools and services to speak the same language and share information about specific vulnerabilities efficiently.

- **TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures):**
  - TTP refers to the behavior of threat actors, including the methods they use to carry out attacks. Tactics describe the overall goals of an attack, techniques are the general methods used to achieve those goals, and procedures are the specific, detailed steps taken.
  - Understanding TTPs helps security professionals anticipate and defend against attacks by identifying patterns in how attackers operate and adapt their defenses accordingly.

By integrating CVE and TTP mapping into the COLE tool, we aim to bridge the gap between known vulnerabilities and the practical techniques used by attackers, enabling a more proactive and comprehensive approach to cybersecurity.
