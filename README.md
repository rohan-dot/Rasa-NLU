# Rasa-NLU
Interning for convergys I made a chatbot for password reset using rasa-nlu.
I trained the bot for password reset functionalities adding the T-opt service and Lanid of the employee and trained it via own examples to make it's answer seem more human like rather than robotic


### Quad Chart

| **Mission and Problem Statement** | **Project Concept** | **Milestones and Deliverables** | **Budget and Schedule** |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Mission:** Ensure the DoD's information security by automating the accurate and consistent classification of documents and communications, thereby reducing the risk of human error and enhancing operational efficiency. | **LLM-Based RAG Approach:** Develop and implement a sophisticated Large Language Model (LLM) augmented with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This solution will automatically classify and mark documents and conversational statements based on their sensitivity (Unclassified, Controlled Unclassified, Secret, Top Secret) using a robust, AI-driven framework integrated with existing DoD information systems. | **Risks:** <br> - Integration challenges with existing systems. <br> - Potential inaccuracies in classification leading to security risks. <br> - High initial costs and resource allocation. <br> - Resistance to change from personnel accustomed to manual processes. <br> **Milestones:** <br> - **M1:** Project Initialization and Requirement Analysis (Month 1-2) <br> - **M2:** Development of LLM and RAG System (Month 3-6) <br> - **M3:** Integration with DoD Systems and Databases (Month 7-9) <br> - **M4:** Testing and Validation (Month 10-12) <br> - **M5:** Deployment and User Training (Month 13-14) <br> - **M6:** Post-Deployment Support and Maintenance (Month 15-18) <br> **Next Steps if Successful:** <br> - Scale the solution across all DoD branches. <br> - Continuous improvement based on feedback and evolving requirements. <br> - Explore additional applications for the LLM-based RAG system in other government agencies. | **Budget:** <br> - Personnel: $1.5M <br> - Infrastructure: $500K <br> - Software Development: $2M <br> - Testing and Validation: $1M <br> - Training and Support: $500K <br> - Contingency: $500K <br> **Total Budget:** $6M <br> **Schedule:** <br> - **Phase 1:** Initialization (2 months) <br> - **Phase 2:** Development (6 months) <br> - **Phase 3:** Integration (3 months) <br> - **Phase 4:** Testing (3 months) <br> - **Phase 5:** Deployment (2 months) <br> - **Phase 6:** Support (4 months) |
