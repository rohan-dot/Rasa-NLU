# Rasa-NLU
Interning for convergys I made a chatbot for password reset using rasa-nlu.
I trained the bot for password reset functionalities adding the T-opt service and Lanid of the employee and trained it via own examples to make it's answer seem more human like rather than robotic

I understand, let me explain the correct mapping.

**Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS)** is indeed closely related to the initial stages of an attack, often involving social engineering tactics to get the victim to click on a malicious link or visit a compromised page.

**Tactic: Initial Access**
- Techniques in this tactic focus on how the adversary gains initial access to the target network or system.

**Relevant Technique:**
- **T1566: Phishing**: This technique covers a broad range of methods where adversaries trick victims into providing information or performing actions (e.g., clicking on a malicious link) that allow the adversary to gain access.

### Explanation:
- **T1566**: This technique encompasses different phishing methods, including those that might involve reflected XSS. In reflected XSS attacks, an attacker often tricks a user into clicking a malicious link, which then executes a script in the user's browser, leading to potential credential theft or session hijacking. This aligns with the description of a phishing attempt using reflected XSS.

Given this context, **T1566** is indeed an appropriate ATT&CK ID for mapping reflected XSS vulnerabilities used in phishing attacks.
