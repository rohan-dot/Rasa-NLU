# Rasa-NLU
Interning for convergys I made a chatbot for password reset using rasa-nlu.
I trained the bot for password reset functionalities adding the T-opt service and Lanid of the employee and trained it via own examples to make it's answer seem more human like rather than robotic

Here are the completed key findings based on the context of the provided abstract and images:

### Key Findings in Authorship Impersonation Using LLMs and RAG

1. **Impersonation Capabilities**:
   - Our pipeline for authorship impersonation, which leverages LLMs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), effectively captures and replicates the writing style of target authors. The process includes generating style-specific descriptions and utilizing a pre-trained model for retrieval and rewrite tasks.

2. **Verification Model Weaknesses**:
   - Current verification models demonstrate significant weaknesses when confronting advanced authorship impersonation techniques. These models often miss subtle stylistic changes introduced by the impersonation methods, resulting in impersonated text being incorrectly classified as genuine.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - The attack success rate is a primary metric used to measure the performance of our impersonation model. Additionally, semantic metrics assess how well the impersonated text aligns with the original author's style. This dual approach highlights areas where verification systems fail and emphasizes the need for improved detection mechanisms.

4. **Ethical and Security Implications**:
   - Our findings reveal critical ethical and security implications, particularly in the context of misinformation and influence operations. The ability to create authentic-looking but fake personas raises concerns about the spread of misinformation and the potential for social manipulation.
   - Highlighted the necessity of robust authorship verification systems and the implementation of stringent ethical guidelines to mitigate misuse.

5. **Practical Applications**:
   - Identified multiple applications for our impersonation techniques, including personalized content generation, creative writing, and educational tools that adapt to individual learning styles. These applications can significantly enhance user engagement and productivity across various fields.
   - However, the potential for misuse necessitates careful consideration and regulation to prevent negative impacts.

6. **Advanced Research Directions**:
   - Proposed further research into enhancing the fidelity of authorship impersonation, focusing on improving the ability to capture and replicate nuanced stylistic elements. This includes the development of more sophisticated models and the integration of multimodal data.
   - Suggested exploring hybrid models that combine different AI techniques to achieve higher accuracy and better contextual understanding.

7. **Impact on Social Dynamics**:
   - Demonstrated that impersonation techniques can simulate social interactions and communication patterns, offering insights into online behavior and the role of influential figures in digital networks. This can inform strategies for information dissemination and community management.
   - The ability to analyze and replicate social dynamics also provides tools for studying cultural and psychological factors in written communication.

These key findings provide a comprehensive overview of the capabilities, limitations, and implications of using LLMs and RAG for authorship impersonation, highlighting the need for ongoing research and ethical considerations.
