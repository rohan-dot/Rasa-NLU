Interning for convergys I made a chatbot for password reset using rasa-nlu.
I trained the bot for password reset functionalities adding the T-opt service and Lanid of the employee and trained it via own examples to make it's answer seem more human like rather than robotic


Subject: Allocation Preferences for Upcoming Months

Hi Dennis, Raul, Allan, and Pedro,

I hope you're all doing well.

I'm reaching out regarding my allocations for the upcoming months, following up on the brief discussion we had yesterday. As you might know, our line proposal ICONEC has been funded for FY24-FY25, and I would like to devote significant time to it, if possible.

Currently, I'm allocated 50% to ADXCC—a collaboration with 57 that I also enjoy working on—and part of my allocation is dedicated to the AI Task Force, specifically working on the impersonation side.

If possible, here's how I would like my allocations to be adjusted:

**Option 1:**
- 50% ICONEC
- 10% AIXCC

**Option 2:**
- 80% ICONEC
- 40% AIKOC
- 20% AITE

I understand that scheduling and allocations can be complex, so I'm happy to discuss this further to find the best arrangement.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
