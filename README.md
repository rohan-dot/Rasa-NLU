Our results showcase the recent capabilities of LLMs to perform complex tasks using just prompt engineering, without the need for fine-tuning. This highlights the effectiveness of zero-shot and few-shot learning approaches, even for sophisticated tasks like authorship impersonation. These methods allow for greater flexibility and efficiency, reducing the time and resources needed for model training.
