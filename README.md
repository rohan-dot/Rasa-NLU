# Rasa-NLU
Interning for convergys I made a chatbot for password reset using rasa-nlu.
I trained the bot for password reset functionalities adding the T-opt service and Lanid of the employee and trained it via own examples to make it's answer seem more human like rather than robotic


Certainly! Here is the revised quad chart with a stronger mission and problem statement, as well as a more cohesive project concept:

### Quad Chart

| **Mission and Problem Statement** | **Project Concept** | **Milestones and Deliverables** | **Budget and Schedule** |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Mission:** Ensure the DoD's information security by automating the accurate and consistent classification of documents and communications, thereby reducing the risk of human error and enhancing operational efficiency. | **LLM-Based RAG Approach:** Develop and implement a sophisticated Large Language Model (LLM) augmented with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This solution will automatically classify and mark documents and conversational statements based on their sensitivity (Unclassified, Controlled Unclassified, Secret, Top Secret) using a robust, AI-driven framework integrated with existing DoD information systems. | **Milestones:** <br> - **M1:** Project Initialization and Requirement Analysis (Month 1-2) <br> - **M2:** Development of LLM and RAG System (Month 3-6) <br> - **M3:** Integration with DoD Systems and Databases (Month 7-9) <br> - **M4:** Testing and Validation (Month 10-12) <br> - **M5:** Deployment and User Training (Month 13-14) <br> - **M6:** Post-Deployment Support and Maintenance (Month 15-18) | **Budget:** <br> - Personnel: $1.5M <br> - Infrastructure: $500K <br> - Software Development: $2M <br> - Testing and Validation: $1M <br> - Training and Support: $500K <br> - Contingency: $500K <br> **Total Budget:** $6M <br> **Schedule:** <br> - **Phase 1:** Initialization (2 months) <br> - **Phase 2:** Development (6 months) <br> - **Phase 3:** Integration (3 months) <br> - **Phase 4:** Testing (3 months) <br> - **Phase 5:** Deployment (2 months) <br> - **Phase 6:** Support (4 months) |
| **Problem Statement:** The manual classification of sensitive information is inherently prone to human error, leading to potential security breaches and inefficiencies. Current methods are inadequate for the scale and complexity of modern DoD operations, necessitating a more reliable, automated solution. | **Key Features:** <br> - Advanced LLM capable of understanding and contextualizing complex language. <br> - RAG system to ensure high accuracy by leveraging extensive databases. <br> - Seamless integration with DoD's existing systems for real-time classification. <br> - User-friendly interface for both document and conversational analysis, ensuring ease of use for all personnel. | **Deliverables:** <br> - Comprehensive Project Plan <br> - Fully Functional LLM-based RAG System <br> - Integration Documentation <br> - Detailed Test Reports <br> - Comprehensive Training Materials <br> - Ongoing Maintenance and Support Plan | **Timeline:** <br> - **Start Date:** [Month/Year] <br> - **End Date:** [Month/Year] <br> **Key Deadlines:** <br> - Requirements Analysis Complete: [Month/Year] <br> - System Development Complete: [Month/Year] <br> - Integration Complete: [Month/Year] <br> - Testing Complete: [Month/Year] <br> - Deployment Complete: [Month/Year] <br> - Support Phase: [Month/Year] |
