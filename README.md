# Rasa-NLU
Interning for convergys I made a chatbot for password reset using rasa-nlu.
I trained the bot for password reset functionalities adding the T-opt service and Lanid of the employee and trained it via own examples to make it's answer seem more human like rather than robotic


Certainly! Here are the answers to the questions based on the provided PDF:

1. **What is unique about the Laboratory's involvement in this area? Why is the Laboratory best suited for this project?**
   MIT Lincoln Laboratory is uniquely involved in developing advanced techniques for style change detection and authorship verification using large language models. The Laboratory's expertise in machine learning, access to extensive computational resources, and focus on cutting-edge research make it particularly well-suited for this project.

2. **How long has the Laboratory been interested in this work? What prompted the Laboratory specifically to work on this?**
   The Laboratory has been interested in this work for several years, driven by the growing importance of identifying changes in authorship styles to detect multi-authored documents, plagiarism, and compromised accounts. The emergence of social media and the need to secure online communications have further motivated this research.

3. **How does this project fit into the Laboratory’s mission of research and development in support of national security?**
   This project supports national security by enhancing the ability to detect and analyze authorship changes, which can identify potential threats such as compromised accounts, plagiarism, and misinformation spread by malicious actors. Improved detection methods contribute to securing communications and protecting sensitive information.

4. **What is the current status of the project? Have there been any recent developments or updates with this work?**
   The project is currently advancing with significant progress. The Laboratory has developed a robust model using MPNet for style change detection and authorship verification, achieving high accuracy on benchmark datasets. Recent updates include outperforming previous methods in the PAN CLEF 2022 challenge and improving performance on the DarkReddit+ dataset.

5. **What do you see as the most important takeaway from this study? How will it influence future work or research?**
   The most important takeaway from this study is the successful application of MPNet in detecting style changes and verifying authorship with high accuracy. This research demonstrates the potential of using advanced language models for security-related tasks and will influence future work in developing more sophisticated models for text analysis and authorship verification.

6. **What has been the biggest challenge with these efforts?**
   The biggest challenge has been dealing with the computational complexity and the need for extensive resources to train large language models. Additionally, effectively balancing the training data to handle adversarial examples and ensuring the model's robustness across different datasets has been challenging.

7. **Do you have any photos or concept images that might be able to accompany a Bulletin feature article?**
   Yes, here attached is the methodology we used for our research.

8. **Is there anything I didn’t touch on above that you’d like to mention?**
   No.
