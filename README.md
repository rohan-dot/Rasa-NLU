Interning for convergys I made a chatbot for password reset using rasa-nlu.
I trained the bot for password reset functionalities adding the T-opt service and Lanid of the employee and trained it via own examples to make it's answer seem more human like rather than robotic



 By automating the process of mapping Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) to Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), the Department of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) significantly improves its capacity to identify vulnerabilities in military systems swiftly and accurately. This technological advancement allows for a more granular and comprehensive understanding of potential cyber threats and attack vectors, directly contributing to the proactive fortification of defense mechanisms. Such automation not only reduces the time required for these critical assessments but also minimizes human error, ensuring a higher level of accuracy in identifying security gaps. Consequently, DOT&E is better equipped to recommend necessary enhancements and strategies to bolster the cyber resilience of the nation's military assets, thereby safeguarding against a broad spectrum of cyber threats with greater efficiency and precision. This evolution in cybersecurity practice represents a significant step forward in maintaining the operational integrity and readiness of U.S. defense systems in an increasingly digital battlefield.
