# Rasa-NLU
Interning for convergys I made a chatbot for password reset using rasa-nlu.
I trained the bot for password reset functionalities adding the T-opt service and Lanid of the employee and trained it via own examples to make it's answer seem more human like rather than robotic



 
 I adopted a casual and enthusiastic persona, using trendy slang and emojis to mimic the communication style often associated with Gen Z influencers on social media platforms. This style is typically lively, approachable, and often incorporates current internet lingo to connect with a younger audience!
