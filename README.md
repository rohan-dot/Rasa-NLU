I trained the bot for password reset functionalities adding the T-opt service and Lanid of the employee and trained it via own examples to make it's answer seem more human like rather than robotic



 
In this study, we employ Retrieval Augmentation and Generation (RAG) alongside Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively identify and counteract hateful speech, guided by the principles outlined in the BEND framework. By compiling diverse, factual datasets—including news articles, official reports, and relevant documentation—we enhance the efficacy of the RAG pipeline. This approach allows for the dynamic prompt-tuning of LLMs to engage with and respond to hate speech in a manner consistent with the BEND strategy.

Specifically, our methodology enables operators to select and implement response and engagement tactics that are most appropriate for the context of the hate speech, as delineated by the BEND framework. These tactics range from taking dismissive actions to actively countering hate speech with accurate, factual content. By integrating the BEND framework's nuanced understanding of narrative and structural maneuvers into our AI-driven interventions, we empower operators to navigate and influence social discourse more effectively, fostering a more resilient digital communication environment.
