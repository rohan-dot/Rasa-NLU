# Rasa-NLU
Interning for convergys I made a chatbot for password reset using rasa-nlu.
I trained the bot for password reset functionalities adding the T-opt service and Lanid of the employee and trained it via own examples to make it's answer seem more human like rather than robotic



 
I apologize for the oversight. Here’s the text with consistent present tense:

"In this study, we employ Retrieval Augmentation and Generation (RAG) alongside Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively identify and counteract hateful speech. Our approach, guided by the principles outlined in the BEND framework, involves compiling diverse data sets—including news articles, official reports, and relevant conversation datasets—to enhance the efficacy of the RAG pipeline. The data, sourced from various online sources, are segmented into chunks and then converted into embeddings using a sentence transformer like MPNET. These embeddings are loaded into the FAISS vector store for efficient similarity searches. Retrieval using the LangChain framework allows for dynamic prompt-tuning of LLMs to engage with and respond to hate speech in a manner consistent with the BEND strategy. Our methodology enables operators to select and implement response and engagement tactics that are most appropriate for the context of the hate speech. Informed by the BEND framework, these tactics range from taking dismissive actions to actively countering hate speech with accurate, factual content. By integrating the BEND framework’s nuanced understanding of narrative and structural maneuvers into our AI-driven interventions, we empower operators to navigate and influence social discourse more effectively, thereby fostering a more resilient digital communication environment."

This should ensure that the verb tenses are consistently in the present tense.
