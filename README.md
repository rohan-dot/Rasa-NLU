 Zero-shot classification refers to the capability of the Mistral model to accurately categorize text as hate speech or non-hate speech without the need for any user-provided examples of either category. This approach aims to minimize classification bias by relying on the model's pre-existing knowledge and understanding, rather than on a potentially biased or limited set of training data.
