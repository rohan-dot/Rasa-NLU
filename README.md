 In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive pipeline to address social media hate speech, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for summarizing topics, detecting hate speech, and generating counter-narratives. Our approach involves manually annotating tweets to assess a zero-shot LLM's accuracy, followed by using a combination of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Mistral models for creating context-specific counterspeech. We further evaluate the effectiveness of our generated counterspeech on criteria such as factuality, relevance, grammaticality, and diversity. This concise overview outlines our methodological framework and key contributions.
