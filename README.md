This is the abstract I have right now
 Government cyber Red Teams today do not have the time and resources to complete their assessments and exercises, as most of their current processes are manual and time intensive. Automation provides some promise to helping Red Teams with tasking, but full automation is not good enough and is not trusted by operators since it lacks incorporating their expert knowledge. Constructing structured representations for vulnerabilities is an important part of the security management data infrastructures. Vulnerability description refers to the text used by vulnerability reporters to describe a vulnerability's cause, the scope of impact, and harm and is the foundation data for constructing vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Description Mapping (VDM) refers to mapping vulnerabilities to Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification, ATT&CK Techniques, and other classifications. Through VDM, people can more quickly understani the technical details of vulnerabilities and their associated exploitation and defense methods, which is important for security management and security research. However, the cost of mapping through manual methods is unacceptable due to the growing size of vulnerability databases In this paper, we perform vulnerability description to ATT&CK Technique IDs using the following two datasets. This dataset is the CVE-ATT&CK Technique dataset with three fields: CVE ID, vulnerability description, and ATT&CK Technique ID. This dataset consists of 7,013 CVE vulnerabilities for the year 2021 (CVE-2021- for which the ATT&CK Technique ID is available through third-party vulnerability databases (eg XuIDB). Dataset III: This dataset is a CVE-ATT&CK Technique Dataset built on BRON (Hemberg et al., 2021) and consists of three fields. CVE ID, vulnerability description, and a list of ATT&CK Technique IDs. Since BRON may 3725 provide multiple ATT&CK Technique IDs for each CVE, a list of ATT&CK Technique IDs is used here instead of a unique ATT&CK Technique ID. (In the real world, a vulnerability may indeed correspond to multiple ATT&CK Technique IDs, and third-party vulnerability databases used by Dataset II usually only provide users with the most prominent ATT&CK Technique ID) This dataset contains a total of 25,439 CVE vulnerabilities Besides, we ignored all sub-techniques in BRON, we establish baseline performance using traditional machine learning models and state-of-the-art pre-trained
[3/25, 22:03] Rohan Leekha: To further enhance Mistral's access to relevant security knowledge, we created a customized retrieval database inspired by the RAG framework. We sourced data from public vulnerability databases, ATT&CK documentation, academic publications, and other web resources. These texts were encoded into a FAISS index using Mistral's embedding space, allowing efficient maximum inner product search at inference time. DEPART automates the curation and fusion of several data sources, including vulnerability databases, exploit sets, threat intel, and network scans. These data sources all come from different places and have different formats, and are all ingested and stored in a database. From there, DEPART uses multiple natural language processing (NLP) and text mining techniques, such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and Jaccard Similarity, to extract features for use in the machine learning (ML) recommendation engine of DEPART. The ML. recommendation engine takes in information about the vulnerabilities, exploits, and known Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures and prioritizes vulnerabilities and exploits found on a network scan or software service with risk scores tuned to a customized adversary of interest. This allows a Red Team to very quickly go from scan data to recommended courses of action for targeting a system of interest.

We have delivered three versions of DEPART to the DOT&E ACO and demonstrated and trained several Red Teams on using it, and incorporated their feedback into updated versions of DEPART. We are working with multiple Red Teams for using DEPART in their operations, both for their networks and assessments, and plan for the tool to be used at an exercise in the near future. Furthermore, there are other promising use cases for this technology in red teaming, and we have started up a new pathfinder with the DOT&E Live Fire Division on using DEPART with a mission planning capability for Adversarial Assessments in support of offensive cyber operations, including assessing the F-35 MPSE
[3/25, 22:04] Rohan Leekha: language models like BERT and ROBERTa. For the mapping of CVE vulnerability descriptions to CWE IDs, we treat it as a multi-class text classification problem. We fine- tune BOBERTa on the CVE-CWE dataset, using the vulnerability description as input and the CWE ID as the target label. We compare against classical ML models like random forests and SVMs trained on TF-IDF vectorized descriptions. For the more challenging CVE to. ATT&CK technique mapping, we explored both multi-label classification and retrieval-based approaches. The multi-label model operates similarly to the CWE mapping, with ROBERTÄ… outputting probability scores across all ATT&CK techniques. For retrieval, we encoded the descriptions and ATT&CK technique texts with ROBERTA and retrieved the most semantically similar techniques for each CVE using maximum inner product search.

While achieving reasonable performance, these off-the-shelf solutions left significant room for improvement on the VDM task. We hypothesized that the main bottleneck was the lack of dedicated training data mapping vulnerability text to structured representations. As large language models like PaLM and ChatGPT, have shown impressive performance when "gostitutionalized or prompted with task information, we attempted a similar approach.

We used prompt engineering techniques to distill, knowledge about VDM tasks into a unified prompt for our own state-of-the-art 7B parameter Mistral language model. The prompt provided an overview of MITRE vulnerability schemas, definitions of key concepts like CWEs and ATT&CK techniques, and examples of good and bad mappings. We then allowed Mistral to condition on this prompt before processing each vulnerability description.

ID, vulnerability description, and a list of
ATT&CK Technique IDs. Since BRON may
provide multiple ATT&CK Technique IDs for
each CVE, a list of ATT&CK Technique IDs
is used here instead of a unique ATT&CK
Technique ID. (In the real world, a vulnerability may indeed correspond to multiple
ATT&CK Technique IDs, and third-party vulnerability databases used by Dataset II usually

Understood, let's refine the abstract with a focus on your use of large language models (LLMs) and the comparison of these models with traditional machine learning (ML) techniques for the task of mapping CVE descriptions to TTPs across two datasets. The emphasis will be on the methodology involving LLMs and the comparative analysis with baseline ML models.

In the dynamic landscape of government cybersecurity operations, the efficiency and accuracy of identifying and mapping vulnerabilities to Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) are paramount. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as BERT, ROBERTa, CYBERT, SecBERT, and MPNET for automating the Vulnerability Description Mapping (VDM) process. Our focus is on enhancing the predictive accuracy and operational efficiency of Red Teams in the government sector, particularly within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).

We utilize two distinct datasets for mapping Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) descriptions to TTPs. The first dataset (Dataset II) comprises 7,013 CVEs from 2021, each linked to a specific ATT&CK Technique ID via third-party vulnerability databases like VulDB. The second dataset (Dataset III), built on the BRON framework, contains 25,439 CVEs, each associated with a list of ATT&CK Technique IDs to acknowledge the multifaceted nature of vulnerabilities.

Our analysis employs these datasets in a two-pronged approach: Dataset II supports a multi-class classification task, while Dataset III facilitates a multi-label classification challenge. By applying LLMs to these datasets, we compare their performance against baseline ML models including Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression, showcasing the superior capability of LLMs to capture the nuances of cybersecurity language and context.

The comparative study reveals that LLMs significantly outperform traditional ML models in mapping CVE descriptions to ATT&CK Techniques, offering enhanced precision in vulnerability assessment. This improvement is crucial for the strategic planning and threat assessment tasks conducted by Red Teams, where accurate and timely identification of potential threats can significantly impact national security.

Our work not only demonstrates the application of advanced NLP techniques to cybersecurity but also opens avenues for further research into the integration of LLMs in government cyber defense strategies. By leveraging the sophisticated understanding of language models, we aim to contribute to the development of more resilient and adaptive cybersecurity infrastructures for the U.S. DoD and other government entities.

This revised abstract concisely captures the essence of your work, emphasizing the use of LLMs in cybersecurity vulnerability mapping and the comparative analysis with traditional ML models.

This paper introduces an advanced approach leveraging machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs) to automate the mapping of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) descriptions to Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of cyber Red Teams.

To tackle this challenge, we deployed a diverse array of LLMs, including BERT, ROBERTa, CYBERT, SecBERT, and MPNET, alongside traditional ML models such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression. This comprehensive strategy facilitates automated VDM across two principal datasets: the first dataset features a multi-class classification task with single ATT&CK Technique IDs, while the second dataset enables a multi-label classification task, allowing for multiple ATT&CK Technique IDs per CVE. The first dataset comprises 7,013 CVEs from 2021, each paired with an ATT&CK Technique ID from third-party databases. The second dataset encompasses 25,439 CVEs, each associated with a list of ATT&CK Technique IDs based on the BRON framework, capturing the multi-dimensional nature of vulnerabilities.

In addition to these methodologies, we introduced a novel approach utilizing the Mistral model coupled with a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) indexing system. This innovative combination leverages the strengths of both LLMs and ML algorithms, supplemented by an advanced retrieval system that enhances knowledge synthesis and information retrieval capabilities, outperforming existing methodologies in the process.

The culmination of this research led to the development and deployment of three versions of DEPART to the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) Analysis and Cyber Operations (ACO). We have extensively demonstrated and trained several Red Teams on using DEPART, incorporating their valuable feedback into subsequent versions of the tool. Our collaboration with multiple Red Teams aims to integrate DEPART into their operations, with plans for its use in forthcoming exercises. Additionally, the technology's potential for broader application in red teaming has sparked a new pathfinder project with the DOT&E Live Fire Division, exploring DEPART's utility in mission planning for Adversarial Assessments to support offensive cyber operations, including the evaluation of critical assets like the F-35 Multi-Platform Support Environment (MPSE).

This body of work not only underscores the pivotal role of automation, ML, and LLMs in cybersecurity but also showcases the practical application and scalability of these technologies within the government sector, offering a beacon for future cybersecurity enhancements.

This multifaceted approach targets the automated mapping of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) descriptions to Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) across two key datasets: one featuring a multi-class classification task involving single ATT&CK Technique IDs, and the other a multi-label classification task accommodating multiple ATT&CK Technique IDs per CVE.

The first dataset, consisting of 7,013 CVEs from 2021, is augmented with ATT&CK Technique IDs sourced from third-party vulnerability databases. The second, more comprehensive dataset contains 25,439 CVEs, each associated with a list of ATT&CK Technique IDs based on the BRON framework, acknowledging the complex nature of vulnerabilities which may map to multiple TTPs.

A novel strategy further augments this analysis by implementing a cutting-edge Mistral model, integrated with a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) indexing system. This approach not only leverages the predictive power of LLMs and ML algorithms but also introduces a sophisticated mechanism for information retrieval and knowledge synthesis.

We have delivered three versions of DEPART to the DOT&E ACO and demonstrated and trained several Red Teams on using it, and incorporated their feedback into updated versions of DEPART. We are working with multiple Red Teams for using DEPART in their operations, both for their networks and assessments, and plan for the tool to be used at an exercise in the near future. Furthermore, there are other promising use cases for this technology in red teaming, and we have started up a new pathfinder with the DOT&E Live Fire Division on using DEPART with a mission planning capability for Adversarial Assessments in support of offensive cyber operations, including assessing the F-35 MPSE

In conclusion, the imperative need for the Department of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) and U.S. national security frameworks to automate the mapping of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) descriptions to Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) through Artificial Intelligence (AI) is evident. The transition from manual processes to an AI-driven approach not only streamlines the assessment and identification of cybersecurity threats but also significantly saves time and resources. This efficiency gain is crucial for maintaining a strategic advantage in cybersecurity readiness and response.

By employing advanced AI technologies, including machine learning models and large language models, coupled with innovative methodologies like the Mistral model and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) indexing, we enable a more dynamic, accurate, and rapid analysis of potential vulnerabilities. This automation directly supports the DOT&E's mission to enhance the effectiveness and resilience of U.S. military capabilities against cyber threats, ensuring that our defense mechanisms evolve in tandem with the rapidly changing digital threat landscape.

Ultimately, automating CVE description to TTP mapping using AI technologies represents a pivotal step forward in fortifying our national security posture. It exemplifies a proactive approach to cyber defense, ensuring that the U.S. remains equipped to identify and counteract emerging threats with unprecedented efficiency and precision.
