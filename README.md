# Rasa-NLU
Interning for convergys I made a chatbot for password reset using rasa-nlu.
I trained the bot for password reset functionalities adding the T-opt service and Lanid of the employee and trained it via own examples to make it's answer seem more human like rather than robotic



 
 Got it! Here are some drawbacks in prior research that your paper addressed:

- **Dependence on Pre-defined Topics**: Previous methods often required predefined topics or labels for hate speech detection, limiting their adaptability to new or evolving content. Your approach overcomes this by employing zero-shot learning, which does not require such predefined labels.
  
- **Data Biases**: Earlier studies were often hindered by biases in their training datasets, which could affect the performance and neutrality of the models. Your method integrates diverse sources and leverages a more robust data filtering process to mitigate these biases.
  
- **Scalability and Efficiency**: Traditional models struggled with scalability and efficiency, especially in processing large volumes of data in real-time. Your pipeline improves on this by using state-of-the-art language models and retrieval-augmented generation techniques, which enhance both the speed and accuracy of processing.
  
- **Generation of Counter Speech**: Prior systems lacked effective mechanisms for generating coherent and contextually relevant counter-speech. Your system excels in generating factual and relevant counter-narratives by integrating advanced AI techniques, which is crucial for engaging and educational discourse.
  
- **Handling Nuanced Forms of Speech**: Existing models often failed to properly interpret nuanced forms of speech such as sarcasm or humor, which are prevalent in online communication. Your research aims to address this through advanced prompt engineering, enhancing the modelâ€™s ability to understand and respond to complex language forms effectively.
