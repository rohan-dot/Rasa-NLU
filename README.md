# Rasa-NLU
Interning for convergys I made a chatbot for password reset using rasa-nlu.
I trained the bot for password reset functionalities adding the T-opt service and Lanid of the employee and trained it via own examples to make it's answer seem more human like rather than robotic

Certainly! Hereâ€™s an equation using the framework components Original Input (OI), Style Criteria (SC), and Style Guidance (SG):

\[
S' = \text{ApplyStyle}(M, \text{OI}, \text{RetrieveStyle}(V, \text{SC}, \text{SG}))
\]

Where:
- \( S' \) is the impersonated text.
- \( \text{ApplyStyle} \) is the function that applies the retrieved style to the original input.
- \( M \) is the pre-trained Mistral model.
- \( \text{OI} \) is the original input text.
- \( \text{RetrieveStyle} \) is the function that queries the vector database to retrieve the style.
- \( V \) is the vector database storing the styles.
- \( \text{SC} \) is the style criteria.
- \( \text{SG} \) is the style guidance.

In LaTeX, the equation can be written as follows:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}

\[
S' = \text{ApplyStyle}(M, \text{OI}, \text{RetrieveStyle}(V, \text{SC}, \text{SG}))
\]

\end{document}
```

This equation captures the essence of the framework, illustrating how the original input is transformed into the impersonated text using the specified style criteria and guidance.
