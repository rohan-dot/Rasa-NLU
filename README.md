Good [morning/afternoon/evening],

Today, I want to discuss a critical challenge we face in the Department of Defense: the classification of documents and communications. Figuring out the level to set a document, or confirming that it has the right markings—whether Unclassified, Controlled Unclassified, Secret, or Top Secret—is challenging and onerous. The current manual process is time-consuming and prone to human error, leading to potential security breaches and operational inefficiencies.

**Motivation and Prior Drawbacks**

The motivation behind our task is clear: we need a reliable and efficient system to handle sensitive information accurately. The manual method we currently rely on is inadequate for the scale and complexity of modern DoD operations. Human errors in classification can lead to serious security risks, while the time-consuming nature of the process diverts valuable resources from other critical tasks.

**Methods**

To address this, we propose testing a technology that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) augmented with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This system will automatically classify and mark documents and conversational statements based on their sensitivity. It will take in guidance and source documents to confirm that markings are correct, provide references, and suggest changes for missing markings. This AI-driven approach will be integrated with existing DoD systems for real-time classification.

**Risks**

There are several risks associated with this project. Integrating the new system with existing DoD systems may present technical challenges. There is also a risk of initial inaccuracies in classification, which could pose security risks. Additionally, the project requires significant investment and resources, and there may be resistance to change from personnel accustomed to the manual process.

**Milestones**

We have a clear plan for the 3-month funding period:
1. **Development and Integration (Month 1-2):** Develop the LLM and RAG system and integrate it with existing DoD databases and systems.
2. **Testing, Validation, and Deployment (Month 3):** Conduct comprehensive testing and validation to ensure the system's accuracy and reliability, followed by deployment and user training.

**Next Steps if Successful**

If successful, the next steps include scaling the solution across all DoD branches, continuously improving the system based on feedback, and exploring additional applications for the LLM-based RAG system in other government agencies.

In conclusion, by adopting this technology, we can significantly enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and security of our document classification process. This project is a crucial step forward in leveraging advanced AI for national security.

Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your questions.
