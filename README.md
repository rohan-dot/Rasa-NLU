# Rasa-NLU
Interning for convergys I made a chatbot for password reset using rasa-nlu.
I trained the bot for password reset functionalities adding the T-opt service and Lanid of the employee and trained it via own examples to make it's answer seem more human like rather than robotic



In the realm of government cybersecurity operations, the task of Red Teams to assess system vulnerabilities is increasingly challenging due to the manual and time-intensive nature of current practices. Recognizing the imperative need for efficiency and precision, this paper pioneers the integration of advanced natural language processing techniques, leveraging a novel methodology that combines the Mistral model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) indexing and sophisticated prompt engineering. This cutting-edge approach is particularly useful for automating the mapping of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) descriptions to Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), a critical task in cybersecurity vulnerability management.

To benchmark the effectiveness of our proposed solution, we conducted comprehensive comparisons with various Large Language Models (LLMs), including BERT, ROBERTa, CYBERT, SecBERT, and MPNET, as well as traditional Machine Learning (ML) models such as Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression. These evaluations were performed across two principal datasets: the first, a collection of 7,013 CVEs from 2021, each linked to a specific ATT&CK Technique ID; and the second, a more extensive dataset containing 25,439 CVEs, each associated with a list of ATT&CK Technique IDs according to the BRON framework.

Our innovative approach, grounded in the synergy between the Mistral model's deep understanding of cybersecurity contexts and the RAG's efficient data retrieval capabilities, has demonstrated superior performance in accurately mapping CVE descriptions to relevant TTPs. This advancement not only streamlines the vulnerability assessment process for Red Teams but also significantly enhances the operational readiness of cybersecurity defenses.

From a national security perspective, the automation of CVE description to TTP mapping using AI-driven technologies is a game-changer. It represents a leap forward in our ability to safeguard critical information infrastructures and national assets against sophisticated cyber threats. The Department of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E), tasked with ensuring that U.S. military capabilities are tested and evaluated for their effectiveness and suitability, stands to benefit immensely from this technology. By incorporating our advanced mapping methodology into their cybersecurity evaluation practices, the DOT&E can achieve a higher level of fidelity in simulated cyber environments, enabling more accurate assessments of military systems' resilience to cyber attacks.

In conclusion, the development and application of our novel AI-based methodology for automating the mapping of CVEs to TTPs address a critical bottleneck in cybersecurity operations. This technology not only promises to save valuable time and resources but also enhances the United States' defensive posture in the cyberspace domain. As we continue to refine and adapt these tools for broader applications within the DOT&E and beyond, the potential for improving our national security infrastructure becomes increasingly tangible, ensuring that we remain vigilant and resilient in the face of evolving cyber threats.
