# Rasa-NLU
Interning for convergys I made a chatbot for password reset using rasa-nlu.
I trained the bot for password reset functionalities adding the T-opt service and Lanid of the employee and trained it via own examples to make it's answer seem more human like rather than robotic



 
Hereâ€™s a revised methodology approach inspired by the BEND framework as detailed in the provided PDF:

**Proposed Social Cyber-Security Framework Using the BEND Approach**

**Objective:** 
Develop a social cyber-security framework leveraging generative AI techniques and large language models to mitigate hate speech and influence operations effectively, focusing on societal context and narrative manipulation.

**Methodology:**

1. **Context Identification:** Employ topic modeling and network analysis to understand the context and origin of hate speech, identifying key themes and influencers using dynamic network analysis.

2. **Data Collection:** Assemble factual, comprehensive data sets including news articles, reports, and other documentation to inform model training and response strategies.

3. **Operative Strategies:** Integrate the following operative strategies to interact with and counteract hate speech effectively:
    - **Engagement Tactics:** 
        - **Positive Engagement:** Use messages that introduce related but constructive topics to alter discourse.
        - **Explanation:** Provide detailed elaboration on subjects to educate and inform.
        - **Encouragement:** Use messages that support and strengthen positive narratives.
    - **Building Tactics:**
        - **Group Formation:** Foster the creation of supportive communities to reinforce positive narratives.
        - **Positive Reinforcement:** Highlight and support key opinion leaders who promote inclusivity and factual information.

4. **Countermeasures for Negative Influence:**
    - **Dismissive Actions:** Downplay irrelevant or harmful topics through targeted messaging.
    - **Neutralization:** Decrease the significance of harmful opinion leaders using strategic communication.
    - **Distortion:** Correct and clarify misleading narratives strategically.

5. **Response and Adaptation:** 
    - **Adaptive Tone and Narrative:** Equip models to dynamically adjust their tone and content, engaging in a conversational manner that is tailored to the immediate social context and user interactions.
    - **Narrative Direction:** Allow AI models and operators to choose and steer conversations towards constructive outcomes, emphasizing resilience against misinformation.

6. **Monitoring and Optimization:** Utilize continuous feedback loops to monitor the effectiveness of interventions and refine AI behaviors based on real-time data analysis and evolving influence tactics as outlined by the BEND framework.

**Goals:**
- Minimize inaccuracies (LLM hallucinations) in AI-generated content by enriching the training process with diverse and accurate data.
- Foster AI-driven conversations that are naturally engaging and contextually aware, capable of influencing social narratives positively.
- Empower AI systems and their human counterparts to selectively enhance or counter specific narratives or social dynamics effectively.
